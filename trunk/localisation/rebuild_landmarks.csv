EVTNAMEarinnitis_favor.1;A sign from Arinniti?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.1;Since deciding to seek to become Arinniti's consort, like Emperor Leo III of the Romans had been hundreds of years ago, you had been wondering how to go about it. This morning, you woke from a sleep troubled by a dream of a bright light limning a woman. She seemed to be telling you something... but what? Surely [Root.GetLordSpiritualName] [Root.job_spiritual.GetFullName] will agree that this is a sign of Her divine favor, and that She will accept me as Her consort!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAarinnitis_favor.1;I must consult my [Root.GetLordSpiritualName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBarinnitis_favor.1;This is but a pipedream...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.2;Since deciding to seek to become Arinniti in Flesh, like Empress Irene of the Romans had been hundreds of years ago, you had been wondering how to go about it. This morning, you woke from a sleep troubled by a dream of a bright light limning a woman. She seemed to be telling you something... but what? Surely [Root.GetLordSpiritualName] [Root.job_spiritual.GetFullName] will agree that this is a sign of Her divine favor, and that She will accept me as Her vessel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEarinnitis_favor.4;The Response;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.4;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA], I have prayed, studied [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], and consulted with my [Root.Religion.GetName] superiors. Now, while I can not entirely rule out the possibility that your dream was a sign from Arinniti that She will accept you as Her consort, given that you lack most of the qualities that She holds dear according to [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], I highly doubt it. I can not stop you from advancing your case with Her Voice on Earth, but understand this: it is a ritual that may be done but once per lifetime, and should you be rejected, there will be dire consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAarinnitis_favor.4;Please, tell me what I can do to improve myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBarinnitis_favor.4;This was a bad idea all along.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.5;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA], I have prayed, studied [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], and consulted with my [Root.Religion.GetName] superiors. Now, while I can not entirely rule out the possibility that your dream was a sign from Arinniti that She will accept you as Her vessel, given that you lack most of the qualities that She holds dear according to [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], I highly doubt it. I can not stop you from advancing your case with Her Voice on Earth, but understand this: it is a ritual that may be done but once per lifetime, and should you be rejected, there will be dire consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.6;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA], I have prayed, studied [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], and consulted with my [Root.Religion.GetName] superiors. Now, while I feel in my soul that your dream was a sign from Arinniti that She will accept you as Her consort, given that you have many of the qualities that She holds dear according to [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], there are still areas where you need improvement. I think you should advance your case with Her Voice on Earth, but understand this: it is a ritual that may be done but once per lifetime, and should you be rejected, there will be dire consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAarinnitis_favor.6;Please, tell me where I need improvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBarinnitis_favor.6;This sounds too risky for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.7;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA], I have prayed, studied [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], and consulted with my [Root.Religion.GetName] superiors. Now, while I feel in my soul that your dream was a sign from Arinniti that She will accept you as Her vessel, given that you have many of the qualities that She holds dear according to [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], there are still areas where you need improvement. I think you should advance your case with Her Voice on Earth, but understand this: it is a ritual that may be done but once per lifetime, and should you be rejected, there will be dire consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEarinnitis_favor.9;The Explanation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.9;First of all, you must understand that this is only possible because Her temple in Chattousa has been rebuilt. That you were the one to do so is greatly to your credit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAarinnitis_favor.9;Yes, but how can I improve myself in Her eyes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.10;First of all, you must understand that this is only possible because Her temple in Chattousa has been rebuilt. That you were not the one to do so is not to your credit, but neither does it hurt your case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.12;Arinniti prefers consorts of great Authority. That you are a man of authority is a mark in your favor, but there is still room for improvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAarinnitis_favor.12;I see. Go on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.13;Arinniti wields great authority in her realm. To be worthy to become Her vessel, it is best to already be a woman of authority. That you are is a mark in your favor, but there is still room for improvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.14;Arinniti prefers consorts of great Authority. That you are not yet a man of authority is a mark against you, but She might not reject you if there are enough other factors in your favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.15;Arinniti wields great authority in her realm. To be worthy to become Her vessel, it is best to already be a woman of authority. That you are not yet one is a mark against you, but She might not reject you if there are enough other factors in your favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.17;More even than authority, piety is important to Arinniti. The more pious a man is, the more suitable he will be to become Her consort. That you are already deeply pious is a mark in your favor, but there is still room for improvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAarinnitis_favor.17;Is there more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.18;More even than authority, piety is important to Arinniti. The more pious a woman is, the more suitable she will be to become a vessel filled by Her spirit. That you are already deeply pious is a mark in your favor, but there is still room for improvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.19;More even than authority, piety is important to Arinniti. The more pious a man is, the more suitable he will be to become Her consort. That you are not deeply pious is a mark against you, but if there are enough other factors in your favor, She might not reject you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.20;More even than authority, piety is important to Arinniti. The more pious a woman is, the more suitable she will be to become a vessel filled by Her spirit. That you are not deeply pious is a mark against you, but if there are enough other factors in your favor, She might not reject you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.25;One thing that all sources agree on is that the ritual must be performed by Her Voice on Earth, at Her temple in Chattousa. Fortunately, the temple has been rebuilt, and [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been established there as Her Voice on Earth. The Goddess' opinion is reflected in the opinion of Her Voice, and fortunately the [FromFrom.GetTitle] is favorably disposed toward you. However, this alone will not be sufficient to become Her Consort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAarinnitis_favor.25;She doesn't expect much of me, does She?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.26;One thing that all sources agree on is that the ritual must be performed by Her Voice on Earth, at Her temple in Chattousa. Fortunately, the temple has been rebuilt, and [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been established there as Her Voice on Earth. The Goddess' opinion is reflected in the opinion of Her Voice, but unfortunately the [FromFrom.GetTitle] is not favorably disposed toward you. However, this alone will not be sufficient to preclude you from becoming Her Consort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAarinnitis_favor.26;This doesn't sound promising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.27;One thing that all sources agree on is that the ritual must be performed by Her Voice on Earth, at Her temple in Chattousa. Fortunately, the temple has been rebuilt, but unfortunately our faith is adrift with no clear Voice to be heard. Before the ritual can be performed, a clear Voice must be established.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAarinnitis_favor.27;Does this mean you want me to intervene in matters of faith?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.29;Arinniti enjoys a good conversation. Therefore it is a mark in your favor that your education was in matters of faith, but unfortunately it seems your education was not of the highest quality...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAarinnitis_favor.29;And I suppose it would be better if my learning was higher?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.30;Arinniti enjoys a good conversation. Therefore it is a mark in your favor that your education was in matters of faith, and of the highest quality...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.31;Arinniti enjoys a good conversation. Therefore it is a mark against you that your education was not in matters of faith...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.33;Yes, I see you are getting the drift of things. Along the same lines, you should not be a wallflower, but rather be comfortable mingling with your guests. I understand you are shy by nature, so that is a mark against you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAarinnitis_favor.33;I suppose being a poet or scholar would be in my favor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.34;Yes, I see you are getting the drift of things. Along the same lines, you should not be a wallflower, but rather be comfortable mingling with your guests. I understand you are gregarious by nature, so that is a mark in your favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.35;Yes, I see you are getting the drift of things. Along the same lines, you should not be a wallflower, but rather be comfortable mingling with your guests. I understand you are neither shy nor gregarious by nature, so that is neither a mark for nor against you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.37;Yes, of course. Arinniti desires a young, handsome, lusty, experienced man as her consort. A man who has not seen the inside of a woman's bedroom, or at most only his wife's, or is wrinkled or otherwise unsightly is not to Her liking. Since you are...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAarinnitis_favor.37;Yes, get on with it. Don't you have better things to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.38;Yes, of course. Arinniti desires a young, beautiful, chaste woman to be Her vessel. A woman who is past her childbearing years, or is unsightly, or has more lovers than a cat in heat is not to her liking. Since you are...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarinnitis_favor.40;Very well. To be brief, Arinniti favors the diligent and not the slothful, the proud and not the humble, those who enjoy generous portions of good food and not those who eat small portions of bland food, the strong and not the weak. If you wish to continue but feel yourself lacking in some areas, you may go to the mountains to meditate before starting the ritual. If She favors you, some of your faults will be cleansed, though some are beyond even Her power to correct. Understand, though, that once you start the ritual, Her rejection will be like unto a curse upon you, but Her acceptance is a powerful blessing. Will you continue on this path?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAarinnitis_favor.40;Yes, I am determined to become Her Consort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBarinnitis_favor.40;Yes, I am determined to become the vessel for Her spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCarinnitis_favor.40;No, it all sounds too risky. I shall continue my life untouched by Her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCarinnitis_consort.3;[Root.GetFOA], if you are truly determined to proceed with the ritual to receive the blessing of becoming Arinniti's Consort, mindful of the possibility of being rejected by Her and receiving her curse instead, I will conduct you into the presence of Her Voice on Earth, [FromFrom.GetBestName]. Remember that during the course of this ritual, which is quite lengthy, you will be sequestered in Her temple unable to conduct the affairs of state, and a regent will be appointed to handle things in your absence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAarinnitis_ritual;Yes. I shall not waver from my decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBarinnitis_ritual;Er... What was I thinking? This was a bad idea all along. Call it off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
