ordepchains.1000.desc;Today you set out for a day outside, to visit the area surrounding your castle, evaluate the overall situation of your peasants and enjoy some of the pleasures your domain has to offer. All seemed well for a while as you visited peasants working the fields and heard from the hunting master how much game that he believed inhabits your woods this year, but something has gone wrong... neither you nor your escort recognizes where you are.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1000.a;Oh boy, well, we can't stop here.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1000.tooltip;You continue forward;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1001.title;A Day At The Ruins;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1001.desc;As you and your escort pass through a patch of thick vegetation, hoping to somehow reach the main road, you chance upon a most unexpected sight. Before you lies a set of old ruins, long forgotten by the inhabitants of the region, as well as time itself. As you walk closer to the ruins, one of your escorts suggests these buildings must have been constructed by the ancient Romans who once lived in this area, but you shake your head and inform him that he is wrong, as you can see what little remains of the constructions is crude and unlike any Roman building would look like. This was once a village belonging to one of the Gallic tribes who once called this land their home. Your other escort informs you that he sees a dark cave in the distance, and also reminds you that time is short and you must find your way to the road. What do you want to do?;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1001.a;A cave? I smell adventure!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1001.a.tooltip;explores the ancient cave;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1001.b;How unique, I'm sure my wife will love to visit;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1001.c;How romantic! A perfect place to invite that beautiful courtier to.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1001.d;Ha, the Gauls, I remember them from my studies...;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1001.d.tooltip;You reflect on the history of the ruins;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1001.e;Meh, let us go look for that road.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1002.desc;As you approach the cave, your men grow restless at how pitch black it is, and urge you to leave it be. Who knows what might be in there?;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1002.a;Weaklings! Are you afraid of the dark?;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1002.b;You know, some things are best forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1003.desc;As you and your men head down the cave, you quickly understand there is not a lot of reason to be excited as what you might discover inside. Apparently this must not have been more than a simple hideout for the farmers or even their cattle against the harsher weather and there is nothing of note for you here. Some of the carvings on the walls seem interesting, but as as far as you know, a child found its way here and drew them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1003.a;Bah! What a waste of time!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1004.title;Ruin Archeology;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1004.desc;As you and your men go deeper into the cave, you are quickly surrounded by a thick darkness, despite your torches. Two things become clear, the cave is deep and almost certainly served a purpose other than a simple shepherds hideout from the rain, and that it hasn't been visited in a very long time. The cave seems deep and you wish to explore and find how deep it goes, but eventually you are forced to give up before you get in too deep and lost. As you make your way out, a faint glitter on the floor catches your attention, and you dig up a silver coin with a strange image of an horse. Blessing your good fortune, you consider whether you should sell it to a rich merchant for a large sum, or keep it as a family heirloom.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1004.a;The money will come in handy!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1004.b;Everyone will be jealous!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1005.desc;As you and your men head down the cave, you are quickly surrounded by a thick darkness, despite your torches. Two things become clear, the cave is deep and almost certainly served a purpose other than a simple shepherds hideout from the rain, and that it hasn't been visited in a very long time. The cave seems deep and you wish to see how deep it goes, but while going through a passage you fail to notice a loose rock and slip, taking a fall and landing on a pile of rocks, hurting yourself and having to be dragged out by your escort. An inglorious end to your quest.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1005.a;Darn!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1006.desc;As you and your men enter the cave, you are immediately assaulted by a strong smell. The cave is extremely dark even with your torch, but you try to look at the walls and the floor to try to determine if anything of worth might be present. Suddenly your blood freezes as something roars behind you, and an angry bear approaches you and your escorts. Apparently you walked into a bear's den! Your men nervously draw their swords, and you must quickly make a decision: fight or flight?;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1006.a;You will make a fine mantle!;;;;;;;;;;;x
you_fight_the_bear;You fight the bear!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1006.b;Runaway!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1007.title;You Fight The Bear;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1007.desc;As you and your men engage the bear in a fight, the beast charges you and attempts to rip your face apart, but you quickly evade its claws by dodging to the side. As your men try to slash at the bear from the side, they quickly find that the bear's thick hide and fur make their sword's blades almost useless. When the bear turns to the side and claws one of them across the chest, knocking him out of the fight, you use this distraction to stab your sword through the bear's neck, severing the artery and causing him to bleed to death. While you are bruised and must painfully claw your way back to the surface, victory is yours today!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1007.a;Remind me not to go into dark places anymore;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1007.tooltip;you defeat the bear;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1008.title;You Fight The Bear;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1008.desc;As you and your men engage the bear in a fight, the beast charges you and attempts to rip your face apart, but you quickly evade its claws by dodging to the side. As your men try to slash at the bear from the side, they quickly find that the bear's thick hide and fur make their sword's blades almost useless. When the bear turns to the side and claws one of them across the chest, knocking him out of the fight, you use this distraction to attempt to stab your sword through the bear's neck, but the beast was faster than you and knocked you to the floor with his massive paw, giving you a nasty scratch across the chest. As the bear prepares to stomp you and finish you off with its teeth, it is suddenly distracted by the remaining guard who attacks from behind, giving you enough time to drive your sword through the beast's chest and sending it to the floor, dead. As the two of you look at eachother, silent and exhausted from the confrontation, you eventually decide to quietly make your way outside, before any more bears show up.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1008.a;Damsels like scars, do they not?;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1008.tooltip;you get hurt in the fight;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1009.title;You Fight The Bear;;;;;;;;;;;x

When the bear turns to the side and claws one of them across the chest, knocking him out of the fight, you use this distraction to attempt to stab your sword through the bear's neck, but the beast was faster than you and catches your leg with its strong bite! You howl in pain as you try to break free but your strength is no match for the bear's mighty size. As you fear the worst your other escort stabs the bear in the back, forcing him to open its mouth and giving you both a chance to flee while shamefully leaving your other man behind. You will likely lose the use of your leg, but at least you didn't lose your life.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1009.a;If I could have war bears I'd rule the world.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1009.tooltip;the bear crushes your limb;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1010.title;Ruin Delight;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1010.desc;Moving in the direction where you know the road is, you quickly find it and head back to your castle in haste, where you separate your wife from her wards and servants and tell her of your amazing discovery. Fueled by your enthusiasm, the occasion quickly turns into an impromptu date as the two of you head towards the ruins, accompanied by some servants carrying food, as well as a larger escort to clear an easier path through the forest. As the day goes by, you have a pleasant time visiting the multiple ancient structures with your wife and enjoying a picnic in the warm sun. You both decide that it is important to maintain this artifact from an age past intact and undisturbed by the peasant's activities, so that it may be enjoyed by your children and their children. As the night draws near and you have to go back home to boring realm matters, you look forward to another day outside.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1010.a;I wonder what other mysteries exist in my realm!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1011.desc;You quickly cut your way through the forest until you find your way back to the main road to the castle. There, you pull your wife away from the wards and servants and tell her of your new discovery and your plans for the two of you to visit the ruins, but she is far from impressed. 'So you found some rocks and ruins? I have matters to attend to, and no time to play explorers like a child, and by the way, so do you!';;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1011.a;But the ruins! It would be such fun!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1012.title;Ruins Delight;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1012.desc;Moving in the direction where you know the road is, you quickly find it and head back to your castle in haste, where you separate your wife from her wards and servants and tell her of your amazing discovery. Fueled by your enthusiasm, the occasion quickly turns into an impromptu date as the two of you head towards the ruins with fast horses forgoing an escort, to the protests of the captain of the guard. As you reach the ruins, you enjoy some quality time alone, starting with admiring the rugged beauty of the ruins, and later moving towards more torrid affairs...;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1012.a;Archeology is fun!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1013.title;Ruins Date Night;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1013.desc;Moving in the direction where you know the road is, you quickly find it and head back to court in haste, where you pull one of your beautiful courtiers aside and tell her of your amazing discovery. Fueled by your enthusiasm, you quickly convince her to join you in exploring these ruins and head off to the site on horseback. After arriving, the two of you marvel at the ancient constructions before you profess your love and admiration for her, after which she falls into your arms.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1013.a;Archeology is fun!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1014.desc;Moving in the direction where you know the road is, you quickly find it and head back to court in haste, where you pull one of your beautiful courtiers aside and tell her of your amazing discovery. Sadly, not even your enthusiasm at this discovery seems to sway your courtier to join you in visiting it, and eventually you are forced to give up on it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1014.a;Bah!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1015.title;The Ancient Gauls;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1015.desc;You take a walk across the ruins and ponder on the Gauls who once lived here. Sadly,the Gauls left few written records and, as such, much of the information that reached your days came not from themselves, but rather their enemies. You recall from your studies of the 'Commentarii de Bello Gallico', written by Julius Caesar himself about his campaign to subjugate Gaul. You recall the many important events of that war, such as when Vercingetorix, leader of the Gauls, stood triumphant over Caesar at the Battle of Gergovia and how the Gallic champion was defeated and forced to surrender his arms before Caesar after the dramatic and bloody siege of Alesia. You also remember Uxellodunum, the final bastion that tried to deny Caesar, as well as the gruesome fate of those who resisted. You wonder aloud whether the romans were a glorious conqueror, or blood thirsty invaders...;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1015.a;Vae Victis. Roma Victrix!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1015.b;This was Gallic land. The romans had no business invading.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1015.c;Who cares? They were both pagan heathens.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1016.title;A Day At The Ruins;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1016.desc;As you and your escort cut through the thick vegetation covering an unfamiliar hill, hoping to somehow reach the main road, you chance upon a most unexpected sight. Before you lies a set of old ruins, long forgotten by the inhabitants of the region, as well as time itself. As you walk closer to the ruins, one of your escorts suggests these buildings must have been constructed by one of the Greek city-states which once called the island their home, but something feels wrong to you, you've seen greek ruins before in the Peloponnesos and these somehow feel different... As your mind wanders, the other escort informs you that he sees a dark cave in the distance, and also reminds you that the time is short and you must find your way to the road. What do you want to do?;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1016.d;Truthfully, I don't think these ruins are Greek at all...;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1016.d.tooltip;ponders on the origin of the ruins.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1017.desc;As you and your men go deeper into the cave, you quickly understand there is not a lot of reason to be excited as to what you might discover inside. Apparently whatever treasure or things of interest ever existed in this place have long been looted by local herders, and the place seems to have been used on occasion as a simple shelter for the cattle against the harsh weather, and there is nothing of note for you here. You return to the surface cursing your luck.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1017.a;Why can't Im ever find treasure?;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1018.title;The Face Of The Minotaur;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1018.desc;As you and your men go deeper into the cave, you are quickly surrounded by a thick darkness, despite your torches. For a long time you have trouble making out your surroundings, and more than once one of your men trips on something he could not see. Finally, after much searching, you find a shrine made by the pagans who once lived on this island. You are immediately drawn to its centerpiece, an exquisite bronze mask of a bull, green from ages of exposure to the elements. Were you to send it to a proper artisan, the mask could be restored and serve as a family heirloom, or maybe it'd be best to simply sell it for profit.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1018.a;It shall be properly restored!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1018.b;It should fetch a good prize.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1019.desc;As you and your men go deeper into the cave, you are quickly surrounded by a thick darkness, despite your torches. You find it hard to sense of your surroundings, but somehow something doesn't seem right to you. You decide to look up and notice some sort of shapes hanging from the ceiling.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1019.a;Are those...;;;;;;;;;;;x
wait_what_is_that;Wait, what is that?;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1020.desc;It only takes the slightest movement from the figures above for you to understand what they are. Bracing yourself for what's about to happen, you tell your men to get down, as a massive swarm of screeching bats wakes up and flies out of the cave. Your men are somewhat startled by the event, but you quickly tell them to keep close and press on. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1020.a;Bats are mice with wings.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1021.desc;You gaze at the black figures above you, and suddenly seem to make out an eye on one of them. A jolt of adrenaline runs through your body as you turn to your men, but you are not able to get a word in before a massive swarm of screeching bats flies out of the cave. When the bats finally fly off, your men find you crouching in mild panic and covering your head with your hands. They help you up, while giving eachother amused glances.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1021.a;I was just looking for my ring!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1022.desc;You gaze at the black figures above you, and suddenly seem to make out an eye on one of them. A jolt of adrenaline runs through your body as you turn to your men, but you are not able to get a word in before a massive swarm of screeching bats flies out of the cave. As you are about to crouch down, one of the bats comes flying lower than the rest and hits you squarely on the face, becoming entangled with you. As you struggle to get it off, he bites you before flying away.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1022.a;This... can't be good.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1023.desc;As you and your men head down the cave, you quickly understand it is completely empty and whatever treasures there might once have been inside are now long gone. Luckily, heading down here hasn't been for naught, as you find a good amount of bat bones on the ground, which are said to grant good fortune. The bats themselves are gone, so you carelessly pick up a few and head out. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1023.a;Maybe they'll lead me to treasure!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1024.title;The Ones Who Came Before;;;;;;;;;;;x
ordepchains.1024.desc;As you walk across the ruins, entering the remains of the houses and what seems to be a temple of some sorts, you start to notice a pattern. You had seen greek ruins before, and these are nothing like anything you had ever seen. You notice how the images of their gods show bulls, men with the head of a bull, and some kind of sorcerer holding serpents in both hands, but no depiction of Zeus, Hera or any greek gods you know about. You note that the remaining buildings are unlike anything you had seen in Greece, and that they resembled the kind of buildings one could see in the ancient ruins of the east. You also note that these ruins are old, much older than the Acropolis in Athens. No, you are sure these are not Greek ruins, but the legacy of a people who came even before them. You tell this to your escort but they are not able to comprehend your reasoning. Frustrated, you instruct them to press onward to home, where you will assemble a group of the brightest in your court and amaze them with your discovery.;;;;;;;;;;;x
