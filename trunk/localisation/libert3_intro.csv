libert3intro.000.name;Lux Invicta has loaded.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.000.desc;and is now at revision v0.6K2. The Invincible Light lives on!\n\nKnown issues include buildings mostly reverted to vanilla for the moment (pending a redesign), and the occasional bugs and/or oversights (we'd of course appreciate them being reported to the Entomology Corner in our subforum). But hey, it's a (nigh perpetual) beta!\n\nIf you're experiencing intermittent/random CTD's not linked to a specific action/event, please make sure you've followed the Important Installation Instructions found in the OP/FAQ, as it's necessary to help the CK2 engine stably run the sheer mass that is the Invincible Light.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.000.a;...So, can I play now?.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.100.name;The Invincible Light.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.100.desc;Hmm. \nSo, you want to play Lux Invicta... \nWant some advice from this thousand-year old wise man residing in a random Solar-Imperial Hellenic court who has done naught but wait for you, as destiny is convenient that way?;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.100.a;I can handle myself.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.100.b;Enlighten me.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.200.name;Welcome to the Invincible Light;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.200.desc;Welcome then, to the shattered world of Lux Invicta. The balance of old world has been undone, and reforged from the dust to the image of the visions of the Creator, whose return we await. This world differs greatly from the old world you call vanilla, and much explanation must be done to explain the gist of the changes. If you wish to unite these lands under your dynasty's banner, know that the path will not be easy.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.200.a;I guess I could stay awhile and listen.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.300.name;Stay Awhile and Listen.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.300.desc;Now then, what shall we discuss?;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.300.a;How to lead.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.300.b;How to fight.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.300.c;How to rule.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.300.d;How to guide.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.300.e;I have heard enough.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.400.name;And so, it shall be.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.400.desc;Then, my task is finished. I have waited for a thousand years for this task, and now my watch has ended and I shall depart.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.400.a;Wait, about these "keys";;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.400.b;Then, I hereby release you.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.411.name;The Arumbic Keys...;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.411.desc;HAH. Very well then. Since you insist, I might as well be gracious and explain them for you. \nz raises levy directly from any county you have control over\nz also toggles siege interface while selecting a province or army in an enemy province.\nz also sends units to the left side of an army or ship balancing screen, each press sends the bottom listed unit left. press and hold for rapid rebalancing\nz will 'cancel' or 'go to' on event windows (such as disband troops, or after a siege/battle has completed)\nz will go to the previous holding in demesne;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.411.a;That's It?;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.412.name;But Wait, There's More...;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.412.desc;\n\nx dismisses the currently selected levy (army or ship), *capital* "x" will dismiss ALL selected levies or ships\nc raises ships directly from any county you have control over\nc assaults holdings when you have an army/county is selected that allows for assaulting\nc Confirms diplomacy interactions, and will 'ok' event windows (such as disband troops)\n;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.412.a;Alright then...;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.413.name;But Wait, There's Even More...;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.413.desc;\n\nv embarks the currently selected levy into a ship that is IN port in that province\nv also selects all armies inside boats if a ship is selected\nv also will close one army at a time while having multiple armies selected. The two previously mentioned shortcuts take priorty. This shortcut is ideal for raiding with multiple armies as a viking. (v selects armies, right click all onto a county, press v, right click onto another county, repeat.)\nv will create a new vassal from the holding screen of minor owned baronies\n;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.413.a;I get the feeling we're not yet done...;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.414.name;But Wait, There's Yet Even More!;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.414.desc;\n\nb merges selected levies or ships, so long as they are in the same zone or province (naturally.) If you have a single army/shipgroup the "b" key will open the new unit interface (ship/army rebalancing)\nb also sends units to the right side of an army or ship balancing screen, each press sends the bottom listed unit right. press and hold for rapid rebalancing\nb will go to the next holding in demesne\nb is also back button for the main interfaces\n;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.414.a;Isn't it about time?;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.415.name;But Wait, There Is Yet Even More!!!;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.415.desc;\n\nn is bound to the 'split army/navy' button\nl toggles looter status for pagan armies\n, opens the ledger, and closes the ledger\n. opens the find characters interface, and also closes it\n<backslash> opens the find title interface\n \nAnd with this, I have taught you all I can, and my purpose serves its end. I think I'll take a little nap. Just rub that lamp in your dynastic intrigue room me once you need me again.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.415.a;Farewell, mysterious mentor;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.311.name;Authority;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.311.desc;Leadership in these lands may change whether you are a feudal lord or a patrician, but in both cases the legitimacy of the ruler matters. This legitimacy is abstracted as your "Authority", from what the old world once merely termed prestige. \nThe Authority of the ruler dictates just how well respected a ruler is, and can influence just how willing his vassals and subjects are to cooperate with his designs. Authority is spent in many actions, from appointing councillors, to granting land to even banishing people. The legitimacy of a ruler is based on his authority after all.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.311.a;That includes ENDING PLOTS, I guess...;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.312.name;Pagan Authority;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.312.desc;Besides taking actions, the value of authority can be even more significant for certain faiths and traditions. Simply put, more tribal-pagan lands look at the authority of a ruler much more so than civilized realms. For a ruler with a large amount of authority, this directly translates to more men, money, and might, and can help that ruler achieve greatness matching the exploits of antiquity. \nA ruler with barely any legitimacy however will find his grasp on his throne much more fragile than he would like, and may even find his realm dissolve if the heir was found unworthy upon ascension..;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.312.a;I guess I should land my heirs then...;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.313.name;Ruler Attributes;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.313.desc;The dynamics of leadership also depends on the realm you lead. A feudal realm is heavily dependent on the strength of its ruler, and thus rulers who have weak stats will drag his realm along with it. On the other hand, a ruler with such skill that he becomes renowned, or even be legendary for it, will greatly benefit his realm. \nPatricians, on the other hand, do not suffer these problems due to the republican nature of their realm. It does take more skill however for them to be able benefit the realm.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.313.a;So, back to the inevitable eugenics game huh...;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.321.name;Culture and Retinues;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.321.desc;Fighting has greatly changed since the days of old. The culture of the province determines the composition of the troops, and with it the tactics employed. Nonetheless, the culture of the ruler determines what kind of elite warriors can be employed as retinue. These retinue must be paid for continuously, yet in exchange have morale and combat bonuses far superior to any levy. \nThese cultural retinues, as well as the elite mercenary retinues, can usually only be obtained by a realm with well-developed provinces, so horizontal expansion must be balanced by a vertical one.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.321.a;A cultural army is a specialized one...;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.322.name;Mercenaries and Levies.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.322.desc;Elite warriors aside, men who fight for money will always be available, and are usually hired with a large lump sum paid upfront, and a much smaller sum paid monthly for upkeep. Vassalized mercs, usually through conquest of their base of operations, tend to be the opposite, charging less for their activation  but costing more to field. \n Mercenaries aside, men who fight to defend their lands in garrisons far outnumber men who fight beyond for plunder and glory. With time, the reverse becomes true for the men of nobles, while the folk of cities and churches stay true.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.322.a;The commanders tend to go AWOL when you "reload" though...;;;;;;;;;x
#libert3intro.322.a;Early conquest might be a tricky...;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.323.name;Combat;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.323.desc;In battle, many things can happen. Not only do combat events fire a lot more than before, and not only do traits matter more in avoiding an unfortunate, but occasionally a duel between generals may occur. Heroic cultured rulers will actively fight and seek out commanders to duel themselves, while non-heroic cultures generally stick to command and rely on their bodyguards to protect them.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.323.a;This isn't fully implemented yet though!;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.331.name;Buildings;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.331.desc;Rulership itself is all about details, and even the smallest of numbers cumulatively have a large effect. One of the most important changes from the old world is with buildings, as holdings represent a general area of a province and buildings its general status. \nBuildings determine the overall status of the realm, and thus must be continuously given attention so that the realm does not stagnate. There will always be provinces that retain their glory from the past though, and these provinces will no doubt be a great boon to their holder.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.331.a;Just keep on building, whatever's up...;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.332.name;Administration and Duress;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.332.desc;Ruling a realm is not just about ruling your lands and letting vassals decide the rest though. A unified realm requires a collective administration, and the tier of the top title determines the capacity of the realm to govern, so a ducal realm cannot govern lands worthy of an empire without being severely crippled. \nAt the same time, as the realm expands, so too does the difficulty in administering all the territories rise. With this comes logistic and bureaucratic inefficiency, causing taxes and levies to shrink and the opinion of others to decrease.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.332.a;The Price of Power is heavy...;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.341.name;Spirituality Enhanced.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.341.desc;Guidance of the people is a critical matter, as religion defines a critical role in determining the way a ruler and its realm works. The religion of the ruler influences his actions, and with it the realm as a whole. \nAt the same time, the religion of the province influences the way the people live, and with it its pecularities and mechanics. Religion also influences the realm as awhole, as some religions put more stock in a great leader, and can influence the way the realm must be handled.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.341.a;The icons have tooltip text now!;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.342.name;Religion and Conversion.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.342.desc;Religion also determines the possibility of certain actions. Whether pillaging neighbours or desire for war, or organisation and legitimacy in succession, or the actions a ruler may undertake, religion plays a fundamental part in rulership. \nLikewise, religion also determines the speed at which they convert, or be converted. Ancestral and Bastion of the Faith religions have a hard time converting, but do not get converted easily, while Proselyte religions convert and get converted faster.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.342.a;Religion mechanics grow by the update, like...;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.343.name;Slavery and Religion;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.343.desc;While many religions forbid the very concept of ownership of fellow man, others are far less stringent, giving rise to the merchants who are more than willing to engage in the trade of men. The two known slaver republics are Qart-Hadash and Aqaba, and these realms are more than willing to play their "merchandise" to rulers whose faith has no qualm with their trade. \nJust as there are men willing to profit from slavery though, there are also men willing to shed blood to put an end to these activities however, so be wary if you ever decide to take on the path of the slaver.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.343.a;If money can buy even men...;;;;;;;;;x
summon_hotkey_ghost;Review the Arumbic Keys;;;;;;;;;x
summon_hotkey_ghost_desc;Forgot how to use the Hotkeys? Summon the ghost of your dynasty's guardian spirit to explain how to use them again.;;;;;;;;;x
summon_hotkey_ghost2;Review the introductory events;;;;;;;;;x
summon_hotkey_ghost2_desc;You know you missed that dead guy. Summon him back, and listen once again to his monologue that may or may not have changed... you never know.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.999.name;Muahahahaha...;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.999.desc;I see you can't get enough of me. So, you wanted something from me? Judging by how your dynasty is more or less surviving, then I'm guessing you don't need me to explain things for you. Rather, what you need is a review of something.... \nAh, the Hotkeys then? I can see it in your face, just begging to say "Please explain how to use them to me once more, oh great mysterious mentor". Am I not mistaken?.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.999.a;Please don't put words in my mouth...;.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.990.name;Muahahahaha...;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.990.desc;So you wished something from me? I can see your puny dynasty all over the place. So, what makes you disturb my peaceful slummber? Is it-;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.990.a;-IT'S ALIIIVEEE! ...anyway, you know what I want.;;;;;;;;;x
libert3intro.990.b;-DIE, GHOST, DIEEEE!!!;;;;;;;;;x
