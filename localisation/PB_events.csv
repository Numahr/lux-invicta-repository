meneth.200.desc;Welcome to Project Balance. This event is here to set up the campaign and to give you a brief introduction to Project Balance. \nProject Balance is much more minimalist than most major mods. Instead of trying to remake the game I've made tweaks in order to make the game both more enjoyable and more historically plausible.\nMake sure to check the "is war possible?" decision to see if you meet the restrictions, and check out the decisions only available on day 0. \nIf you encounter any issues or have any questions or feedback you can contact me in Project Balance's thread on the Paradoxplaza forums. Alternatively you can send me a PM on Paradoxplaza or on reddit. \nI hope you'll enjoy the mod, \n- Meneth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.200.a;OK;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#meneth.204.desc;We've just won a kingdom in a Crusade. We could choose to keep the kingdom for ourselves or we could give it to someone else in our family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

meneth.205.desc;Feeling little loyalty to their far off ruler, the peasant rebels of [Root.GetName] desire to align with a nearby ruler instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.206.desc;The pious are rewarded for their efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.206.a;OK;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.208.desc;For whatever reason, you hold a kingdom or empire that has no Internal Peace law. Perhaps you recently formed an empire, and the game thus didn't give you Emperor's Peace, or perhaps you're an emperor who formed a kingdom. Either way, this event should fix that for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.209.desc;It appears that refusing the Pope wasn't a good idea. He has decided to excommunicate us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.209.a;We are excommunicated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.210.desc;We have been excommunicated due to our war against the Papacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.210.a;This is a disaster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.212.desc;You usually shouldn't be seeing this event, but for whatever reason the game thinks you're still at a tournament despite it being over already. This event fixes that, so you can hold tournaments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.213.desc;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has requested an exchange of prisoners. [FromFrom.GetSubjectPronoun] wants [From.GetTitledFirstName] released, and will in exchange release one member of our dynasty from their dungeons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.213.a;Let us do so without delay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.213.b;I have no interest in his prisoner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.214.desc;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has agreed to release [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], and we've in turn released one of their dynasty members.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.215.desc;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has not agreed to release [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.217.desc;The laws of your realm prevent you from instituting anything but minimal obligations from your vassals. Your demesne laws have therefore been returned to minimum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.219.desc;It is time for a faction meeting. We will determine what action to take, if any, once we know how everyone feels about our liege's rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.220.desc;A faction meeting has begun, and the first point on the agenda is to determine how the faction as a whole feels about [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s rule. What is your opinion?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.220.a;Overall, I'm pleased with [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.220.b;No opinion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.220.c;[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] must right some injustice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.221.desc;Based on the faction vote, the following options are available to us. What action should we take? Your choice will be put to a vote.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.221.a;Support our liege;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.221.b;Strengthen our position;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.221.c;Demand crown authority reduced;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.221.d;Weaken liege;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.222.desc;A vote has been called on whether or not to provide [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] with financial support for the current war. The proposal is to contribute a tenth of our income this year to fund [Root.Liege.GetHerHim]. Do you support this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.223.desc;All the votes have been tallied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.223.a;The vote succeeded;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.223.b;The vote failed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.224.desc;All the votes have been tallied. The vote succeeded;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.225.desc;All the votes have been tallied. The vote failed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.226.desc;My loyal vassals have decided to provide me with financial support for the current war. Perhaps this will tip the scales in our favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.227.desc;A vote has been called upon whether to demand lower vassal obligations. It is proposed that we present [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] with an ultimatum. Do you support this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.228.desc;It seems that my vassals are unhappy with their current level of obligations. They're demanding that I change the law. Should I accept the ultimatum?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.229.desc;A vote has been called upon whether to demand title revocation removed. It is proposed that we present [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] with an ultimatum. Do you support this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.230.desc;As usual, my vassals are complaining about the title revocation law. This time, however, they've served their complaints to me along with an actual ultimatum. Do I sacrifice the law? I potentially face a dangerous revolt if I do not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.231.desc;A vote has been called on whether to demand revocation of the internal peace law. It is proposed that we present [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] with an ultimatum. Do you support this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.232.desc;A confluence of my vassals demand that I revoke a law of the land, allowing vassal war and infighting. What should I do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.233.desc;[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] has refused our ultimatum! Should we call for open revolt?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.234.desc;[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] has refused our ultimatum, and the faction leader is calling for an open revolt! Is revolt the right choice?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.235.desc;The votes have been tallied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.235.a;To war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.235.b;Peace in our time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.236.desc;We have decided to call a vote for the reduction of crown authority. How should it be reduced?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.236.a;Lower obligations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.236.b;No revocation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.236.c;No internal peace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.237.desc;We have decided to call a vote to weaken our liege. How should [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] be weakened?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.237.a;Force release of imprisoned vassals;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.237.b;Give away a county;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.237.c;Give money to the faction;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.237.d;[Root.Liege.GetSheHeCap] should bloody abdicate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.238.desc;The faction leader wants [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] to release all vassals currently held prisoner. Do you support this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.239.desc;The autonomy faction demands that I release all vassals currently held prisoner. It could be worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.240.desc;The faction leader wants our liege, [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName], to give away a county. Do you support this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.241.desc;My greedy vassals demand that I just give away one of the counties in my demesne! Shall I cave?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.242.desc;The faction leader wants our liege to send all of the faction's members an appropriate amount of gold and silver. Do you support this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.243.desc;My avaricious underlings have gotten the courage to demand that I give them gold as reparations for whatever wrong they imagine me to have done them. Should I do this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.244.desc;The faction leader wants [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] to allow external inheritance. Do you support this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.245.desc;Most of my vassals demand that I change crown law in order to allow them to inherit titles external to the realm, something which may consequently allow them to leave my realm, taking a piece of it with them when they do. Should I do it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.246.desc;The faction leader wants [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] to abdicate from his position as our liege lord. Do you support deposing [Root.Liege.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.247.desc;By [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], I'd never thought it would come to this. A dissident, powerful faction of my vassals has voted to demand my abdication as their rightful liege lord. Should I humbly accept the ultimatum? If not, I'll risk allowing the realm to be torn apart by revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.248.desc;We have decided to take an action that will neither hurt nor harm our liege. What action should we take?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.248.a;Preserve the status quo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.248.b;Share military supplies and leadership, boosting our levies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.248.c;Cooperate in economic development endeavors;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.249.desc;The faction leader has called for increased cooperation between faction members. This can only be good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.249.a;Military cooperation begins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.249.b;Economic cooperation begins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.250.desc;We have decided to support our liege, [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]. What action should we take?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.250.a;Provide financial support for the current war;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.250.b;Give [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] a commendation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.251.desc;The faction leader wants to commend our liege for the good job that [Root.Liege.GetSheHe]'s done ruling the realm while upholding our rights. Do you support this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.252.desc;I have just received word that my vassals want to commend my rule of the realm as well as recognize my just protection of their rights and, indeed, the vassal contract. I'm not sure whether to accept with pride or only with the greatest humility, but either way, I will gladly receive their commendation with honor and gratitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.253.desc;Many of my important vassals sent riders to let us know that they are meeting to discuss my rule, with all due respect to the law. All in all, they seem happy. If anything comes of the meeting, I'll hear within days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.254.desc;Many of my vassals are holding a meeting, one of the topics of which is the quality of my rule. They probably don't have any aims but the status quo, although they may decide to go forward with autonomous cooperation measures which have recently been proposed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.255.desc;A solid group of my vassals have been riding for days in order to meet, many openly criticizing my rule. My spymaster, [Root.job_spymaster.GetBestName], reports that a number seem to be pretty disgruntled. If anything serious actually comes of the their complaining, I'll know within days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.256.desc;My vassals have wisely decided not to act upon my refusal to heed their ultimatum. They might not be so quick to stand-down in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.257.desc;Most of my vassals have decided to cooperate in order to improve their own situation. While this doesn't directly affect me, it does make them a greater potential danger to my rule. On the other hand, it may be easier to squeeze some extra coin or levies from them if the need should arise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.257.a;They will be able to field more soldiers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.257.b;They'll cooperate in economic development;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.258.desc;According to the tally, we are to revolt. If there are any second thoughts, now is the time to voice them. We intend to mobilize in three weeks. If you wish to stay loyal to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName], in addition to voicing your opinion now, you MUST manually leave the autonomy faction before the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.258.a;To war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.258.b;I refuse to be a part of this petty revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
faction_members_angry;This will degrade relations with all faction members that do not also refuse the call to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.259.desc;The votes have all been counted, and we will not revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.260.desc;It is time to launch our revolt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.261.desc;It seems my vassals do indeed have the nerve to act upon my refusal to heed their outrageous ultimatum. I must prepare for war immediately: they'll be able to mobilize and march upon [Root.Capital.GetName] within the month. If blood is what they want, then blood is what they'll get.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.400.desc;It is time we asserted our dominion over Anatolia. We should invade Iconium.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.400.a;To war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.400.b;I'd rather not;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.401.desc;A member of our dynasty has established himself in a position of power in Anatolia. Perhaps it would be best to let him rule Anatolia independently?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.401.a;Very well;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.402.desc;The formation of the Rum Sultanate provides us with the perfect opportunity to declare independence from the empire. If we petition the emperor for independence he will likely grant our request as he knows it'll be almost impossible to project his power here now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.402.a;Petition for independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.403.desc;The rulers of Cilicia and Antioch have petitioned me for independence. Their lands are of course part of my realm by right, but I'm not sure I've actually got the means to keep them obedient. Granting them independence would be admitting that we cannot reconquer our lost lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.403.a;Grant them independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.403.b;Deny them independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.404.desc;The emperor has granted our request for independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.404.a;Rejoice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.405.desc;The emperor has refused our request for independence! We should go to war and gain it by force of arms, then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.406.desc;We've achieved independence by military means!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.407.desc;We are in a prime position to further extend our dominion over Anatolia. It is time we took the rest of this peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.408.desc;We've successfully taken the rest of Anatolia, only the city of Trapezous still resists our dominion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.409.desc;We've lost Anatolia, but we can still reclam the coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.410.desc;The emperor tried to take our rightful lands, but we repelled his attempt. Our dominion over Anatolia is now clear to all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.411;Formation of Rum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.411.desc;With the Byzantine armies crushed by the Turks, Turkish warlords have exploited the power vacuum left by the Byzantine retreat. \nThey have managed to gain near complete control over the Anatolian peninsula. A dark shadow looms over the future of the once great empire; will foreign invaders and internal trouble spell its doom, or will it persevere through it all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.411.b;This can only mean trouble;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.411.c;Even once great empires may fall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.412.desc;Ensures that Armenia isn't dejure Byzantine when it shouldn't be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.413.desc;The Bulgarians have long been a thorn in our side. Now, as a result of the Rumites taking much of our rightful land they have become brave enough to actively resist our rule. They demand increased autonomy or they will make our rule hell. If we deny them it might make other groups troublesome as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.413.a;Lower the taxes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.413.b;Keep the taxes high and force them into the army;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.413.c;Give them some autonomy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.414.desc;The unrest caused by the Bulgarians has spread to [Root.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.415.desc;The unrest caused by the Bulgarians has dissipated from [Root.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.416.desc;The Emperor has decided to ignore the Bulgarian demands for autonomy, and as a result there is now constant unrest amongst the Bulgarian population. Members of other ethnic groups have used this as an opportunity to express their discontent with the empire. We can expect this unrest to leave a lasting impact on the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.416.a;This concerns us greatly as our lands are affected;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.416.b;Luckily our lands remain unaffected;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.417.desc;The Emperor has decided to grant the Bulgarians significant autonomy within the empire, placating them. For now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.418.desc;The Bulgarians are rising against our rule, and war is inevitable unless we give into their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.418.a;Give them independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.418.b;To war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.419.desc;Have some free troops;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.423.desc;Now that we have managed to retake all of Iconium our rightful rule of all of Anatolia is once more recognized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.428.desc;Now that we have held onto the position of emperor for several years our Bulgarian kin has come to understand that the reasons for their unrest have come to an end. This can only be good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.420.desc;We now hold the kingdom of Galicia, but there is no prestige in holding this title, so it shall be lost to the annals of history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.421;Quest to Reclaim the Holy Land;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.421.desc;The Holy Land has been in the hands of the Heathens for far too long now. It is time we took back what is ours by the grace of God. A Crusade for Jerusalem is imminent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.421.a;Deus Vult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.421.b;I'd like to see the infidels try!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.421.c;What concern is this for me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.422.desc;Now that we are recognized as the rightful king of Portugal we shall claim our rightful lands once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.424.desc;With our recent conquest of England we should form a small army to deal with any revolts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.425.desc;With how far removed we are from William the Conqueror, the Norman Company no longer has any loyalty to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.426.desc;With the Magyars settled in the Carpathian Basin, we can now move away from our enemies into their former territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.427;Holy Roman Empire formed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.427.desc;A new empire has been formed from German and Italian lands, claiming it is the one true successor to Rome. It is a decentralized realm, but still one that could potentially rise to greatness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.437.desc;A new empire has been formed from French and Italian lands, claiming it is the one true successor to Rome. It is a decentralized realm, but still one that could potentially rise to greatness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

meneth.433.desc;Now that we have complete control over Aragon we shall claim our rightful lands once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.436.desc;Having recognized us as the rightful king of Sicily, the Pope has decided to return the duchy of Benevento to our control, though the bishopric will remain under his control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.502.desc;Do you want to enable special Casus Belli that make conquest much easier? This will also remove all restrictions on holy war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.503.desc;Do you want all merchant republics destroyed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.504.desc;Do you want to make all counties Feudal? Won't affect merchant republics if you chose not to destroy them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.506.desc;Do you want to have lucky AI realms? If you click yes three random AI rulers (one Christian, one Muslim, and one Pagan) will become ambitious, get 500 gold, 250 prestige, 100 piety, and a free 3000-man army. You will get the choice to add three completely random lucky AIs after that. You'll be able to add as many as you want, though 3 to 12 is recommended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.506.a;Give it to me as well;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.507.desc;Do you want to have three more lucky AI realms? If you click yes three random AI rulers will become ambitious, get 500 gold, 250 prestige, 100 piety, and a free 3000-man army. You will get the choice to add another three random lucky AIs. 3 to 12 is recommended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.509.desc;You've got some armies you're not supposed to have. They will now be despawned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.510.desc;Do you want to make all rulers immortal? This will also kill any dyasty members that aren't rulers and make the rulers infertile, and will enable an event causing an immortal to take over if there's any independent non-immortal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.510.a;Only make me immortal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

meneth.601;The Baqt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meneth.601.desc;The Baqt was an agreement between the Ethiopian kingdom of Makuria and the Muslim rulers of Egypt. In exchange for free trade between the peoples, they were to live in peace with one another. Maintaining the Baqt provides safety and revenue, but prevents expansion. An ambitious ruler can seek to violate the Baqt and earn power through war rather than trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
