LENTTITLE;Lent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.0;The holy season of Lent is upon us, and all pious Christians, save the infirm and those on a journey, should observe the fast for the next forty days, abstaining from meat and having but a single, simple meal in the evening, save only on the Sabbath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.0;Lent has started.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.1;Even as Pilate released Barabbas before the first Easter, you contemplate releasing your prisoners...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.1;Yes, set them free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBlent.1;No, they are where they belong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.2;Jesus taught the importance of charity and good deeds, which are especially important during the holy season of Lent. There are many poor in [Root.Location.GetName] who could be helped if you but parted with some of your treasury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.2;Yes, make it so. Distribute alms to the poor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBlent.2;No, I would not disturb their fast by giving them means to buy food...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.3;Now is the time for prayers and observing the Stations of the Cross.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.3;Yes, I will thus draw nearer to God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBlent.3;No, I do not have the time to spare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.4;The meatless diet you have been observing during Lent has weakened you to the point of illness. As the ill are exempted from fasting, there would be no shame or loss of piety if you abandoned the fast and made up for the lost days at a later time. If you continue, however, there could be serious repercussions to your health...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.4;Yes, I need time to recover from this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBlent.4;No, I feel fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.5;Your decision to continue fasting despite your illness has proven a costly one. You have become infirm with weakness due to lack of food and water, and left with no choice but to interrupt the fast.z;Votre dÈcision de continuer ÅEje˚ner malgrÅEla maladie a eu une consÈquence tragique. Le manque de nourriture et d'eau vous a rendu infirme et vous n'avez d'autre choix que de cesser le je˚ne.;Eure Entscheidung, trotz Eurer Krankheit mit dem Fasten fortzufahren, kommt Euch teuer zu stehen. Ihr seid gebrechlich geworden aufgrund der Ermangelung von Essen und Wasser, und hat Euch keine Wahl gelassen, als das Fasten zu unterbrechen.;;La decisiÛn de continuar con el ayuno a pesar de tu enfermedad te ha salido cara. Has entrado en estado de debilidad debido a la falta de agua y alimentos, y no te ha quedado otra opciÛn que interrumpir el ayuno.;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.5;Perhaps next year...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.6;The fast you have observed during Lent has taught you the value of moderation in all things, and the dangers of indulgence and excess. You feel closer to God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.6;I am a new person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.7;You have given generously to the poor during Lent and performed many good deeds. The urge to help those in need comes naturally to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.7;I feel like a better person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.8;The ongoing war demands your full attention, and you and your men can no longer continue your fast. You will have to make up the lost days at a later date.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.8;So it must be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.9;You have become ill and will have to abandon the fast. The lost days will have to be made up at a later date.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.9;So it is.;;.;;.;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.10;The end of Lent approaches, and that means Easter is upon us. The preparations for the planned feast to celebrate this have already been made, and now the time has come to invite your vassals to your palace. What say you, Master?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.10;Send out the invitations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBlent.10;No, I have a headache. Cancel the festivities!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.11;Peace be upon you, [Root.GetTitledName]. The end of Lent draws near, and to celebrate Easter I have decided to hold a great feast in my palace. You are of course invited.\n\nWith respect,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.11;I am honored to accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBlent.11;No, I have other plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.12;Peace be upon you, [Root.GetTitledName]. I give thanks for your invitation to celebrate Easter at your palace, but I regret to inform you I cannot attend.\n\nYour servant,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.12;So [From.GetSheHe] dares refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.13;The great banquet you ordered held to celebrate Easter and the end of Lent was a rousing success! The food was exceptional, the entertainment magnificent and a great time was had by all. Your guests seemed suitably impressed by your wealth and generosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.13;The Lord has risen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.14;The great banquet held by [From.GetTitledName] to celebrate Easter and the end of Lent was a splendid occasion. The food was exceptional, the entertainment magnificent and a great time was had by all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.14;The Lord has risen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.15;To celebrate Easter, perhaps you should present a gift to your beloved spouse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.15;Of course! I will buy [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim] a golden necklace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBlent.15;No, my affection for [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim] is gift enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.17;The hunger pains you experience during the fast have become unbearable due to your gluttonous nature. With the sun still high in the sky, you break into the pantry and help yourself to the food inside while tears stream down your face...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.17;Mmhf... c-can't.. help myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.18;Overcome with lust and in broad daylight during the fast, you sinfully engage in the pleasures of the flesh with a serving girl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.18;I should not have done that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.19;Though strict observance of the fast requires you to abstain from food and drink during the daylight hours, you helped yourself to enough wine to fall into a drunken stupor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.19;I-I'm sho shorry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.20;Many in [Root.Location.GetName] have donated generously to provide for the poor during the holy season of Lent. The gold has been gathered in an urn but when you approach it to donate your own share, your greedy nature results in your coin purse gaining weight instead of losing it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.20;No one will miss a few coins...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.21;As a cynical unbeliever, you do your best to uphold the appearance of observing the fast, but behind closed doors you do not think twice about eating and drinking to your heart's content, be it day or night. One day you are caught in the act...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.21;I-It's not what it looks like!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
observe_lent;Observe Lent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
observed_lent;Observed Lent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
observe_lent_desc;As a Christian you observe the Lenten season every year, but you will be paying particular adherence to it this time. Upon its conclusion, a great banquet will be held to celebrate the Easter holiday.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTOOLTIPlent.12;Invitation rejected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTOOLTIPlent.14;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTOOLTIPlent.13;Easter feast is held.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.22;Your fast and observance of the holy season of Lent has ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.22;Until next year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTOOLTIPlent.22;The fast ends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESClent.23;One of your courtiers has obtained a barnacle goose. Some say that this creature, believed to be born on driftwood and develop underwater, is acceptable fare for Lent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAlent.23;That is clearly a bird, tempt me not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBlent.23;We shall eat this fine fish tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
