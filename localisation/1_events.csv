EVTDESC554350002;Your [Root.GetMarshalName] tells you a longwinded story about Megas Alexandros. You think you've heard it before but are not sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350002;Yes, I have! My knowledge of history is unrivaled!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350002;No, I haven't! The story taught me new things about warfare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA554350003;Knowledge of ancient times can help us build a better future!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC554350005;An old noble famed for his wisdom arrives at your court. You spend the night together...in deep conversation. You now feel enlightened!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350005;Diplomacy is the best weapon in a ruler's arsenal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350005;A ruler's trade is war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350006;Upon a whim you decide to go and talk to your peasant subjects. Surely they must have something interesting to say? If not you can always punish them for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350006;I learned something about farming...I think...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350006;At least I heard some interesting rumors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350007;While walking through the streets you spot a thief!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350007;Good for him! Thievery does pay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350007;Time to stop him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350008;Your spymaster managed to find a supposed enemy spy. The unfortunate wretch has been brought before you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350008;Torture him, then salt his wounds!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350008;Be gentle! He might not be a spy after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350009;You hear strange noises in the middle of the night! You've heard the stories about the ghosts of your ancestors coming back to haunt your line...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350009;I need to hire some exorcists!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350009;My ancestors are my friends! Greetings honored ones!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350010;Frightened peasants believe ghosts roam the land! Some of the frightened wretches were brought before you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350010;Ghosts? I'll send some priests to deal with them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350010;But, I know all those ghosts by name!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350011;A local priest proclaims the spirits of your ancestors need to be pacified... Surely he is crazy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350011;He is right! Ancestors need their due.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350011;But, they told me they loved me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350012;A famed exorcist arrives at your court. He claims you are possessed by the spirits of your ancestors and asks for payment in order to banish them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350012;Maybe he is right! Time to pay up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350012;No! My ancestors and I are good friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350013;While roaming the countryside looking for game you only manage to find a lone peasant. Your bloodthirsty [Root.GetMarshalName] suggests he might prove to be entertaining game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350013;It's peasant hunting season!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350013;Reprimand your Marshal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350014;While walking around through town, a beggar latches on to you. He claims to be an old friend of your father, now fallen into destitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350014;Guards! Get rid of this pest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350014;The world is cruel and unforgiving!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350015;A crazed youth challenges you to a duel in front of your court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350015;Time to put him in his place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350015;What is the world coming to!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350016;An old preacher is brought before you. He lectures you on religious doctrine and asks that you commit yourself to the cause of the Divine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350016;I believe! I believe! I believe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350016;I have no time for divine matters...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350017;A priest tries to talk to you about divine matters. His knowledge of doctrine is impressive, but can he leave a lasting impression?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350017;I have found faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350017;Faith is for women and old men...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350018;A zealous courtier talks to you about matters of faith. His enthusiasm might be contagious...or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350018;I am ready to believe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350018;I believe you believe...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350019;A supposedly wronged noble challenges you to a duel. You are not quite sure what he's on about, but the court is spoiling for a fight. Will you fight him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350019;My sword is ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350019;But I did nothing wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350020;A servant was caught stealing an ancient family relic. He is about to be executed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350020;Make it painful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350020;I will spare his life...this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350021;As you stroll around town, you happen upon a public execution. A young lad, no more than 10 is about to be killed for some reason or other...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350021;No one escapes the law in my realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350021;Surely we can't be killing children?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350022;As you enter your bedroom you see a book on your pillow. Why is that book on your bed? You've never seen it before!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350022;It must be poisoned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350022;Maybe someone wants me to learn something?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350023;Your spymaster brings you a gift. It's an old manuscript concerning ancient espionage techniques. You are puzzled by the present and decide to see if reading it might teach you something...or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350023;I know everything already!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350023;Spying is an art form!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350024;Some peasants believe they saw a comet! You haven't, but unfortunately there's talk about portents heralding the Apocalypse all around your court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350024;Nonsense! The comet is a herald of my greatness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350024;It's a plot! My enemies must be sowing unrest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350025;You actually saw a comet! The tales of these celestial messengers are true! It even had a tail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350025;The comet is my horse in the sky! I must ride it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350025;Celestial portents are never good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350026;A courtier died in his sleep and no one noticed for days. You happened to be passing by as his rotting body was being removed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350026;Drinking will make you forget the smell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350026;One day I shall be like him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350027;One of your friends has died in his sleep without any apparent cause!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350027;Let us drink to his memory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350027;The world is cruel and unforgiving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350028;An old warrior regales you with tales of his youth. You can almost hear the din of battle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350028;Strategy before tactics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350028;Famous battles will inspire me to glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350029;As you walk the streets you find a leper beaten almost to death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350029;I shall nurse him to health!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350029;I must get away from this wretch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350030;An old companion of your father arrives at your court. The old warrior is now a frail leper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350030;You see to his every need!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350030;Lepers are not welcome here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350031;A sick old woman claiming to be your wet nurse arrives at your court. She is coughing blood! You do see a resemblance...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350031;It is her! I shall see to her care!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350031;Away with the hag!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350032;A ruler's work is never done... It is past midnight, and you desire to sleep... yet your [Root.GetChancellorName] suggests you review some documents...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350032;Sleep is the province of weaklings!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350032;Enough! I will rest when I want to!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350033;There is so much work to be done...and it keeps piling up! Who said rulers lead a pampered life?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350033;Not I! I shall work myself to death if need be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350033;I did! To Tartarus with work! I shall rest on my laurels!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350034;One of your courtiers works all day and night. Some say he never sleeps. People are starting to use him as an example.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350034;I can be more like him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350034;That bastard makes me look bad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350035;One of your friends is well known for his charity. Your subjects can not help but talk of him with great admiration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350035;I can try this charity business!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350035;That bastard makes me look bad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350036;An old priest demands that you practice the virtue of charity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350036;Sigh, charity might have its merits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350036;Priests should know their place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350037;A group of foreign nobles arrives at your court. They keep trying to pester you with questions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350037;And I shall answer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC554350040;You visit an old friend. His cooks have prepared a great feast in your honor! Many exotic foods await your sampling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC554350041;Petitioners arrive at your court. You decide to actually listen to them this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350041;Justice will reign!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350041;Decisions are best made by flipping coins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350042;An old retainer comes to you. He talks about the many abuses committed by a local magistrate and demands that you take action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350042;Justice is our province!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC554350076;Your courtiers are worried. You've been spending too much time talking to the spirit of one of your ancestors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350076;What spirit? I am my ancestor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350076;Maybe I should stop thinking of glorious ancestors...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350077;Your dreams are plagued by visions of the founder of your bloodline. You've even started talking to him while wide awake, ignoring your courtiers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350077;My blood is strong! He and I are one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350077;Ancestors are dead and buried...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350078;A specter haunts your nights. His cold laughter echoes in your ears, and his words become ever more seductive! His words promise greatness, if you only would follow his advice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350078;The blood must flow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350078;I need no advice from ghosts...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350079;A courtier keeps interrupting you when you speak. You've warned him about it, but he can not help himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350079;Cut off his tongue and feed it to the dogs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350079;Sigh, let him speak... again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350080;A councilor keeps speaking out of turn during council meetings. Even the other council members are getting tired of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350080;Enough! Pin his tongue to the council chambers door!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350080;It's his job to counsel us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350081;One of your nobles keeps annoying everyone at court with his never ending monologues. He is a bit loud too... Some suspect he might be crazed, but his tongue never stops wagging...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350081;I shall have it detached!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350081;People should speak their mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350082;You hear rumors that one of your nobles has taken to boiling criminals alive! He is supposedly becoming ever more of a connoisseur regarding the screaming of his victims... You decide to investigate the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350082;Let us boil a few criminals together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350082;Horrifying! Make the screaming stop! Now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350083;One of your nobles is renowned for his cruelty. Whenever he sees a beggar, he cuts off the beggar's right hand. He is known to be making a collection...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350083;I want to be a collector too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350083;Barbaric! I shall stop this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350084;A nobleman famed for his cruelty is brought before you. His accuser is a young peasant lass. The nobleman has killed her father on account of him insulting the nobleman's ancestors... The insult was quite horrific to be fair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350084;Peasants need to be put in their place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350084;There is no excuse for murder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350085;Ruling is a task you seem to enjoy less and less. Maybe you should focus more on other aspects of life?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350085;I am happy with my lot in life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350085;It's time to put more effort into achieving greatness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350086;An old courtier has recently died. On his deathbed he told you that the secret of happiness is being content with your lot in life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350086;I agree with him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350086;The old man was a fool!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350087;You had a conversation with a priest. He told you that you should not seek greatness in this life, for those who are content are surely rewarded in the next!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350087;I await the afterlife!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350087;I am not so certain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350088;Your court is rife with gossip! You often overhear things that would make a devil blush!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350088;I don't want to hear it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350088;I'm sure they must be gossiping about me as well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350089;A noblewoman famed for her beauty and intellect arrives at your court. Maybe you should try and see if the stories of her intellect are true?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350089;Leave me alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350089;She might be smarter than me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350090;Your courtiers are debating philosophical issues. They can't agree on a particular intellectual matter. What came first: the chicken or the egg?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350090;I'll shut up and pretend to be wise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350090;I'll tell them! I could be wrong though...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350091;Your [Root.GetTreasurerName] has come to you with a long term plan to develop your lands. It might take decades before it comes to fruition...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350091;I'll finance it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350091;Decades? Decades? Madness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350092;A traveling scholar arrives at your court. He is more than happy to lecture you on a variety of subjects. It's a pity he could bore even God to sleep...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350092;I'll listen and learn...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350092;Get this wretch out of my sight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350093;An old childhood friend has come up with a plan to improve the prosperity of your lands. He's always been good at making money, but this time he's thinking long term...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350093;I'll follow his advice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350093;Long term? We could be dead tomorrow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350094;Your [Root.GetTreasurerName] believes you should hold a banquet. It would be a good opportunity to talk to your nobles about the affairs of the realm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350094;Talking is what I do best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350094;I want to be left alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350095;A famous scholar challenges you to a duel of wits. He proposes a bet, the winner of the philosophical duel takes the prize!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350095;Money is no issue! Let the duel begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350095;I care not for such frivolity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350096;Several foreign merchants arrive in your capital. These foreigners are rumored to come from a land beyond even great Khitay! Maybe you should entertain them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350096;A feast it is! I wish to talk to these travelers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350096;My mother taught me not to talk to strangers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350097;A famous artist painted a portrait of your father. Your courtiers believe it is a masterpiece. You are not so certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350097;My father had a much bigger nose!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350097;History should remember him in a flattering manner...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350098;A famous Hellen sculptor arrived at your court and offered to make a statue of you. You decide it's a good idea to be immortalized for the ages. The end result might be too flattering though...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350098;Make another statue! This one is not me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350098;Posterity will remember me as the god I was!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350099;A famous poet arrived at your court and offered to write a timeless epic regarding your immortal deeds. He would elevate you to greatness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350099;But I am not so great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350099;Glory is a manufactured product!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350100;An old priest is preaching about morality. He claims that being humble is a virtue... He actually believes only the humble will be welcome in Paradise...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350100;I humble myself before the Divine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350100;I prefer an earthly Paradise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350101;An old courtier told you that the meek shall inherit the Earth...or so some priests say. He seems to be quite enamored with the concept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350101;I am quite meek myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350101;Why inherit anything when you can seize it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350102;A traveling Roman scholar arrives at your court. He offers to teach you about your own ancestors! He claims to have knowledge few others have... you somehow doubt it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350102;I shall listen intently, his knowledge could be greater than mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350102;My knowledge of my own bloodline is unsurpassed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350103;Your swordplay is getting rusty... even your courtiers have noticed you aren't as good as you used to be. Maybe you should go and practice some!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350103;The pen is mightier than the sword!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350103;Practice makes perfect!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350104;Your [Root.GetMarshalName] thinks your fighing skills are getting rusty... He could be right, you do feel unfit for a proper battle. Maybe you should go and practice some?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350104;Let my sword rust, I'd rather read!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350104;Sharpen that blade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350105;You've been spending too much time with your councilors lately, and too little time practicing your fighting skills. Your old swordmaster frowns every time he looks at you... Maybe you should hone your sword skill some?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350105;I have others to do the fighting for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350105;My sword shall become part of me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350106;A priest approaches, telling you he has information only you must hear. You allow him to come closer and whisper in your ear... He tells you that you are about to meet the Gods as he produces a dagger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350106;My heart is pure, my soul is ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350106;Fight him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350107;As you walk towards your room, you notice that your guards are nowhere to be seen. Footsteps can be heard behind you. You turn and see several men approaching, swords drawn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350107;Time to show them my worth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350107;Run away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350108;As you watch a troop of entertainers perform, one of them suddenly turns towards you. He makes a mad dash at you, waving a dagger and shouting: Sic semper tyrannis!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350108;I'm a fighter not a tyrant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350108;Tyrants know when to retire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350109;As you enter the council chamber, your councilors surround you. A young protege of yours starts quoting Cato: "...against any man using unlawful force, every man has a right to use force..." Daggers glint...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350109;Kai su, teknon?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350109;Time to retire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350110;You've invited an old enemy of yours to court. As you feast your future friendship, he offers a toast to honor your ancestors! He sips from his cup then passes it on to you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350110;Drain the cup! Divine power favors the brave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350110;Take a sip...then let the cup fall to the ground...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350111;A noble descended from an ancient Roman patrician family is visiting your court. After endless declamations about the nobility of Augustus, he starts talking about Roman orgies...Things aren't as they used to be these days, for sure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350111;But we could bring back the old days!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350111;Orgies are better consigned to history...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350112;You've been hearing rumors that one of your nobles has been reviving the ancient Roman practice of orgies... Apparently his home is a den of endless depravity, countless men and women fornicating in endless lust!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350112;It is my... duty... to investigate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350112;O tempora, o mores!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350113;One of your courtiers has been reading too much about history lately... namely Roman orgies! That rascal proposes that you should honor old Rome with some historical re-enactments!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350113;Let us live history!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350113;No thank you, history is boring anyway!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350114;A strange foreign merchant has arrived at your court. He is dressed in outlandish fashion, and your courtiers whisper in amazement. None has seen his kind before! Maybe you should invite him to stay awhile?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350114;Foreigners are not welcome here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350114;Be my guest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350115;A strange foreign traveler has arrived at your court. He claims to be a pilgrim from a far off land, beyond the very Great Wall of Khitay... he says. He could tell you much about the world if only you would offer him your hospitality...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350115;What's this Great Wall nonsense? Away with him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350115;I was always interested in walls!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350116;A strange foreign noble has arrived at your court. He wears ruined silk clothes and wears two strange swords. He claims to be from a far off island realm... from the very land of the Rising Sun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350116;The only thing rising is my temper! Away with this beggar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350116;The Sun also rises... around here... yet maybe we should discuss this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350117;A strange foreign merchant has been brought before you. He claims to be from far off Khitay... and to have a wondrous artifact for sale! He produces a magnificent jade mask and explains that it was once worn by the very first Emperor of his land, a ruler called Qin Shi Huang!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350117;An Imperial mask will hide my blemishes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350117;I am not worthy of owning such an artifact, and need it not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350118;A strange foreign merchant has been brought before you. He claims to have the sword of the old king Artorius in his possession... the legendary Excalibur! Those who wield Excalibur are destined for undying glory... if only you would spare the coins?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350118;My sword is better, but I can use two!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350118;I need no glory...and I am unworthy of wielding such a sword!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350119;A Levantine merchant is brought before you. Your courtiers whisper anxiously, as he produces a rusty spear! He claims this to be the Spear of Destiny, the very spear used to pierce Jesus on the Cross! If you were to wield it, you would conquer...but conquests cost money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350119;The spear is mine! Destiny awaits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350119;I do not wish to get involved in the affairs of the Divine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350120;An old courtier keeps lecturing you on the times of yore... He's always telling you how your ancestors were better than you, how the past was so great, and the present... well, the less said about the present... the better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350120;I agree, we are not worthy of our illustrious ancestors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350120;Nonsense! To Hades with this wretch! I'll tell it how it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350121;Your old wet nurse is chastising you about your behavior. She seems to think she is exempt from reprisal! She is also quite bold about it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350121;I shall be a good [Root.GetLadLass]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350121;What the Hades is she talking about? Away with the hag!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350122;A priest has taken up to lecturing you on proper moral conduct. He seems to think you might not fit the ideal of virtuous behavior! Surely you don't need to keep listening to this fool?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350122;I shall listen in virtuous silence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350122;Proper moral conduct! I'll tell him a few things about proper moral conduct!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350123;A frail old noble starts lecturing you about virtue. He tells you a story about your great-grandfather's honorable conduct and supreme virtue...Surely you've been found lacking in this area?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350123;Virtue! Senile bastard, get out of my court! Go to my great-grandfather!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350123;I shall embrace the path of virtue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350124;An old tutor has returned to court. He is saddened to see what he considers the sorry state of affairs your nobles find themselves in. He asks that you try and educate them about the virtues of honor and proper moral conduct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350124;Tell your tutor you are the teacher now... in a rude way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350124;Honor! Morality! Proper conduct!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350125;An old noble fallen into destitution arrives at your court. He is too proud to ask for financial help, instead he lectures you on morality. He tells you the tale of the fall of his house, and how intrigues can bring even the greatest lineage to its knees... He cautions you against the wickedness of such actions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350125;I can see why the wretch lost it all! Out of my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350125;I shall follow the path of honor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350126;An old friend of yours thinks you're becoming lax with your martial training. He asks that you start training with him once more... Surely this can only help?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350126;Mens sana in corpore sano!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350126;My time should be dedicated to achieving glory, not useless training!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350127;Ruling is hard work... and the more you work at it, the harder it gets. Surely you need a break? Some physical exercise might strengthen you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350127;I feel full of energy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350127;I need to dedicate myself to ruling!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350128;A priest of the goddess Nike, the Hellen goddess of victory, arrives at your court. He used to be a famous athlete of the Hellenes in his youth, and has quite a few stories to tell... You decide to listen to his tales. The athlete turned priest tells you that the secret of success in any endeavor is... exercise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350128;Just do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350128;Exercise must mean preparation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350129;A famous Hellen philosopher arrives at your court. Your courtiers don't know what to make of his visit. You do though... you always do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350129;Let us discuss dialectics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350129;Lecture the philosopher on religion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350130;A famous Sophist philosopher arrives at your court. He seems to be an expert on Arete... He believes he could teach you a few things about the art of oratory, but would much rather debate philosophy with you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350130;Let me explain to him why Sophists are wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350130;Virtue is only found in Religion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350131;A traveling scholar, who proclaims himself a follower of Socrates arrives at your court. He booms that Truth is the highest value, and that Truth can be uncovered by following the path of reason... if only one could spare the time to analyze things properly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350131;I always find time for analysis!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350131;Truth is the province of the Divine alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350132;A so-called German philosopher -you did not even know they existed!- arrives at your castle. He introduces himself as Hegelius and starts droning about something he calls Dialectikkksss. You listen to his every word intently...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350132;Everything is transient and change is helical!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350132;Time to pray for his soul!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350133;A Hellen scholar, proclaiming himself to be a disciple of Heraclitus of Ephesus, the Weeping Philosopher, arrives at your court. He tells you how the ancient philosopher thought that everything is in constant change and that all entities are subject to the Logos...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350133;No man ever steps in the same river twice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350133;Praying should cure this nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350134;"Your [Root.GetChancellorName] has taken up reading some philosophical nonsense. What's worse is that he's started quoting that book.\n ""The death of fire is the birth of air, and the death of air is the birth of water.""\n ""All things come into being by conflict of opposites, and the sum of things flows like a stream.""\n And so on and so forth...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350134;Let us analyze these sayings together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350134;Order him to start praying and repent this nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350135;One of your councilors berates you for your thoughtlessness. He believes you would greatly benefit from trying to put some thought into whatever you're doing - before you do it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350135;Maybe he is right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350135;Thought should follow action!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350136;One of your servants has taken up painting miniatures in his spare time. You notice this and decide to investigate his work. It is quite brilliant... Some rulers might actually be impressed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350136;I should try it myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350136;What nonsense! I have no time for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350137;One of your magistrates presents you with an unsolved case. No one can figure out who is the culprit since there's a gigantic pile of contradictory evidence. You suspect no one even tried to sift through it all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350137;I should try to find out the truth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350137;Truth is best found by following your instinct!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350138;A suspected criminal is brought before you. The man seems unfazed by your presence, and demands that you deliver justice in his case...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350138;I can find out the truth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350138;I don't even want to talk to criminals!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350139;One of your magistrates invites you to speak your mind in court about an ongoing case. Some courtiers think that it would do you good to take an interest in the affairs of justice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC554350140;One of your friends thinks that you should be more assertive when dealing with your councilors. He tells you that you should not let them rule you, but you should rule them instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB554350140;Let them do their job! I don't want to deal with them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350141;A renowned Eastern swordmaster has arrived at your court. You find his two swords strange, but he does move with catlike grace... He offers his services telling you that he would teach you the art of inner discipline!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350141;Discipline is the key to greatness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350141;Discipline makes one predictable...and intrigues destroy the predictable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350142;The captain of your guard offers to show you how your guardsmen are trained. He is a harsh taskmaster and a firm believer in discipline... maybe you could learn something from him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB554350142;I'd rather spend some time with my spymaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350143;An Eastern monk arrives at your court. He lectures you about the wonders of inner discipline, and the great feats man can achieve if only he can rule himself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350143;Inner discipline shall set us free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350143;Only a spy could think of such nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350144;One of your courtiers keeps babbling about every subject imaginable. Your [Root.GetMarshalName] thinks you should ignore the fool and keep him at a distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350144;I will follow his advice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350144;Nonsense! I find his gossip interesting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350145;A young noblewoman is famous for spreading rumors. Her appetite for gossip is insatiable. One day she approaches you and tries to strike up a conversation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350145;Nod your head at her and leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350145;You don't say!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350146;An old relative of yours spends all of her time talking about the supposed secrets of your nobles. Everyone finds her immensely entertaining - as long as she is not talking about their secrets! Maybe you should listen to what she has to say?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350146;No. I am above such things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350146;Secrets! I loooove secrets!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350147;One of your childhood friends strikes up a conversation with you. He tells you about his misfortunes... Apparently he owes moneylenders a large sum of money... Maybe he needs some help?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350147;Friends require help in times of need!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350147;They all want to profit from me!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350148;A noblewoman friend of yours keeps talking about a merchant from Khitay... and the beautiful silks he sells... You know she does not have the money to buy the fabrics, but no one seems to take the hint and help her out...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350148;A gift for my friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350148;Friends are only good for leeching away your wealth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350149;An old lame courtier, who is supposedly your friend... or so everyone says... just broke his bejeweled crutch. Apparently the crutch was an ancient family artefact of inestimable value... Repairing it would cost a fortune...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350149;What's a crutch between friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350149;Friends are the crutches of the weak!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350150;A young noblewoman wants to be your friend... or so her father says... Could this be true? You spend time talking to the young lady, and the more time you spend the more you find out that she is quite interested in various luxuries... Maybe you should get her some?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350150;Friends do come with maintenance costs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350150;Spending money on friends? Ridiculous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350151;One of your nobles is a bit loud... to put it this way... his voice could splinter the heavens... and he talks all the time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350151;Listen to him and stay calm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350151;Prove you can be louder than him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350152;Your captain of the guard keeps screaming at new recruits... Unfortunately, you keep hearing his screams... they reverberate around the entire fort... and they do disturb your thoughts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350152;I shall stay calm! Screaming is the mind killer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350152;Scream at him a bit to shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350153;"An unhinged inconsiderate courtier keeps calling you ""honey""... in a very loud and obnoxious voice at that! Your councilors redden whenever they hear this! Soon enough rumors will be spreading... What can come of this?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350153;Nothing. I am unfazed by this nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350153;You lose your temper and put the bastard in his place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350154;You've been avoiding work lately... You seem to be much more interesting in anything but work... from staring down servants, to counting clouds... 10372, 10373, 10374...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350154;Who knew cloud counting could be this rewarding?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350154;Maybe I should get back to work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350155;Your [Root.GetTreasurerName] brings you a pile of reports and dumps them at your feet... apparently you should have read those months ago, instead you've been... administering to your own desires... or some such.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350155;I shall administer my own desires some more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350155;Let's see what this stuff is about!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350156;Your [Root.GetMarshalName] thinks you should stop putting off inspecting your household troops... He argues that you should know the men who protect your very life...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350156;Maybe tomorrow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350156;My life? Let's get to it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350157;You look at your courtiers in horror... They have so many petitions that need solving, you can't even begin to count them... Maybe you should do something about it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350157;Why do anything today, when I can do it tomorrow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350157;Let's see to it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350158;You've found an ancient manual describing the tactics of the Parthian Empire! There's some fascinating information about the various tactics the Parthians used to humble the Seleukidai...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350158;I shall study this thoroughly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350158;Act first, that is the essence of strategy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350159;Your [Root.GetMarshalName] presents you with a gift. It is an ancient manual on Hellenic battle tactics. It describes the uses of pike formations and the famous hammer and anvil tactics of Megas Alexandros!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350159;Time to strategize!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350159;It's all about acting first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350160;An old nobleman presents you with a gift...a priceless manuscript of De Re Militari by Vegetius! Surely you can learn something from this ancient tome?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350160;Time to brush up on my military knowledge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350160;I need no knowledge, I need action!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350161;A famous old scholar comes to your court. He seems to specialize in military matters, and offers to teach you about Vegetius and his detailed accounts of the ancient Roman military... camp preparation, troop training, strategy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350161;Let he who desires peace, prepare for war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350161;The only strategy I need is my instinct!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350162;Your courtiers have taken up playing a strange strategy game, using carved miniature soldiers... You watch them play it much too often...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350162;Join them! Strategy games can prepare one for war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350162;I would rather watch... I am not good enough to play...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350163;A Persian noble has arrived at your court...and he's been teaching your courtiers a strange game! It's called chatrang and involves moving carved pieces on a board... you watch them play it for a while then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350163;Time to join in! This seems like a good exercise in strategy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350163;I'll keep on watching. I would surely lose if I play...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350164;Nobles keep coming to you... and ask you to help them out... in various ways... mostly involving money... Destitution seems to have become a rule among your nobility these days...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350164;My money is my own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350164;I need to help my fellows the best I can...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350165;One of your former tutors has fallen into destitution... He's arrived at your court begging you to help him pay his creditors... Sadly, it's quite a large sum, but the old man used to be a good teacher...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350165;He should have taught himself how to manage money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350165;I consider this a repayment for his teachings...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350166;A long lost friend has arrived at your court in chains... His creditors brought him to you! Apparently he thinks you might pay his debts... Surely you can't let him suffer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350166;You owe him that much? Suffer fool, suffer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350166;I'll pay his debts... Strike off those chains...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350167;One of your best friends is starting to become annoyed by your unchanging behavior. You never do anything out of the ordinary, or indeed ever seem to do anything you haven't done before... You also tend to spend a lot of money on your rather questionable habits...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350167;I might be boring but I am constant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350167;This is no business of his!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350168;People have started to notice your unchanging behavior. You never deviate from your rather costly habits... and keep annoying people with your... constancy. Maybe you should change?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350168;All is as it should be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350168;This business is making me moody...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350169;"You have become the very symbol of constancy! People give you as an example, as a resolute, steadfast and honorable friend... and some do take advantage of this. One of these ""friends"" has just asked you for money... again...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350169;I stand by my friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350169;I feel a foul mood approaching...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350170;An old Hellen scholar wishes to teach you about Calliope... Apparently she was one of the nine daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne... but most importantly the Muse of epic poetry and eloquence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350170;Calliope, be my Muse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350170;Boooring...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350171;An old Roman scholar arrives at your court. He apparently wishes to teach you about eloquence... Ex-loqui...out of speaking or something, something! He goes on about the great eloquence of past Romans... and you do learn a thing or two!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350171;Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350171;No, I don't want to learn anything...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350172;A traveling Arab scholar arrives at your court. He offers to teach you about... eloquence. He starts talking about The Nahj al-Balagha, The Peak of Eloquence, the great wisdom of Ali, and the unequaled knowledge of Sharif Razi...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350172;I shall reach the Peak of Eloquence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350172;I'd rather climb a real peak...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350173;A famous Platonic philosopher arrives at your court, wishing to lecture you on many a subject. Your [Root.GetChancellorName] challenges him to teach you about rhetoric... He starts a long diatribe about rhetoric being a means of deceit to convince the gullible masses to do your bidding...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350173;But that's exactly what I need to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350173;I am one of the gullible masses myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350174;A famous Hellen scholar arrives at your court wishing to teach you. He is an expert on Aristotle... He keeps on blabbering about errr... what did he say? Torture is a viable rhetoric tool? Maybe I should listen closely...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350174;I shall torture you with my sublime eloquence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350174;I definitely have a talent for torture...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350175;You've started to talk to people lately, more and more and more! Some say you're trying to become the very magnet of people's attention!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350175;I have become...magnetic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350175;Maaaaagneets... what are they?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350176;You've started to enjoy talking to your nobles... and the more you talk, the more you like it. You obviously don't listen to them, you do all the talking yourself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350176;Talking is easy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350176;No it isn't...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350177;Your [Root.GetChancellorName] gave you some pointers on how to become the very center of attention... Maybe you should follow his advice?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350177;Gather around, people... and listen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350177;I need no pointers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350178;You've taken up judging... You greatly enjoy giving verdicts... although it has to be said, you don't seem to be very rational about it? People are starting to whisper...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350178;Reason is hidden from the eyes of the masses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350178;Maybe I should think about it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350179;One of your courtiers, who is apparently too wise for his own good, keeps going on about something called rationality. Apparently rulers should be reasonable too...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350179;Nonsense! Reason is for frustrated subjects only!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350179;Maybe I should try to be more reasonable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350180;An unsolved murder case is brought to your attention... Supposedly you might be able to solve it... using your superior intellect and reasoning skills...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350180;Reason? Evidence? Let's expose Chaos Theory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350180;Maybe I should get my mind around this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350181;Your one of a kind bird, brought to you by an expedition to a faaar faaar away land... a talking wonder called a paaaarroot... died!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350181;Woe! Woe! Woe is me! I want my bird back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350181;That bird used to soothe my nerves...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350182;Your favorite dog just died... You've had him since he was a puppy, and now he's gone... forever! You doubt very much dogs get any chance of an afterlife...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350182;The Gods took away my best friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350182;That dog was keeping me sane...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350183;A few years back a courtier had given you a very strange furry little creature... a Persian cat! While the cat had a bad temper and scratched everyone bloody - including you - its unexpected death proves to be a blow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350183;Why hast thou forsaken me, my little furball? Why?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350183;No more fur petting for me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350184;An unsolved mystery is bothering your courtiers... Everyday an object disappears... The strange part of this is there's an alphabetical order to their disappearence, and some other strange rules behind these misdeeds, they can not quite pinpoint...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350184;I'll solve the mystery using my intuition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350184;I'll start collecting evidence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350185;Your [Root.GetChancellorName] is bothering you, yet again, with some business or other... He's given you a lot of documents to look over...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350185;I'll just use my intuition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350185;Time to start working...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350186;A rather convoluted case regarding the inheritance of one of your great nobles is brought to your attention... Maybe you could issue a verdict?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350186;But I know the correct verdict already!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350186;I will sift through these piles of evidence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350187;One of your nobles has arrived at your court asking for an audience. He seemingly needs your help with some matter or other...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350187;I only help myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350187;It is my duty to help others!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350188;A beautiful young courtesan is being accused of witchcraft... Her beauty has enraged the wives of her clients! She does seem to be quite bewitching... although this should be an issue of protecting the innocent, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350188;If she is a witch, she must burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350188;There's no magic here, only the magic of kindness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350189;"An old senile retainer of your father's is brought before you by his son. He shows you how the old man keeps drooling and whispering silly things: ""Moooo! Moooo!"" The son asks that you give him his father's estates and let the old man find peace...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350189;That old man is possessed! Send for an exorcist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350189;I will take care of the old fellow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350190;The orphan baby son of one of your household guards is brought before you. His father died protecting you, and his mother took her own life in grief. Surely you can do something for the child?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350190;I shall see that he is raised properly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350190;His parents are dead... there's no point to his life really!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350191;A crying little girl is brought before you. Her father killed her adulterous mother... then jumped off a tower! Such a tragic tale, and the little orphan has no one to take care of her...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350191;I will see to her comfort!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350191;And you brought her to me, why?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350192;Your father's favorite stallion is now old and decrepit. Gone is the noble thundering of his hooves! You look at the poor beast and wonder... Maybe it should be put down?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350192;No! This horse is part of the family!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350192;I hear horse meat is very tasty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350193;An old Hellen warrior, claiming to have served as a heavy cavalryman, arrives at your court. He tells you stories of glorious Hetairoi charges led by none other than Megas Alexandros!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350193;I feel like charging myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350193;A ruler's place is in the rear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350194;A Parthian warrior, newly arrived at your court, tells you stories of famous kataphrakt charges. He recounts the tale of an ancient general called Surena and his famous kataphrakts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350194;I would lead my kataphrakts to glory too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350194;But I thought Surena didn't end all that well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350195;An old Roman aristocrat is teaching your friends about the military virtues of Caesar. Supposedly at the Siege of Alesia, Caesar actually led from the front! Could it be true?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350195;Obviously so! And I shall be a new Caesar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350195;Nonsense! A great leader does not risk himself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350196;An old scholar recounts the life of Marcus Antonius. He lectures you on the supposed heroism of Marcus Antonius in the Battle of Actium! You are not so sure about this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350196;No, he is right! I shall follow Marcus to glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350196;I don't think following Marcus Antonius's example is a good idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350197;A fabulously rich merchant offers to teach you the secrets of making money... Some of your courtiers think this is a good idea, maybe you should approach him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB554350197;I'll do it tomorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350198;A magistrate, famed for his administrative efficiency, offers to teach you how to become a better ruler. He would meet with you tomorrow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350198;Efficiency uber alles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350198;I have better things to do tomorrow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350199;A rather infamous slave merchant offers to teach you the secrets of the trade... for a price. He claims that the slave trade is similar to ruling a realm, and you would be wise to listen to his knowledge...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350199;Time to turn my subjects into slaves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350199;I'd rather do some hunting first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350200;An old Roman general, turned bureaucrat, arrives at your court and offers to teach you a thing or two about bureauctatic efficiency... at a price...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350200;Efficient bureaucracies are no myth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350200;Later... I'm going to... create some mythology today!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350201;During a stay at one of your vassals's mansions, you realize that your home simply does not compare... Surely this needs to be put right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350201;I need to do something about it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350201;Not at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350202;Your [Root.GetChancellorName] berates you about your supposed lack of ambition. He believes it is about time you set your sights on greater things... Could he be right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350202;My sights are set!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350202;Ambition is for those who want to lose their eyesight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350203;An old noble tells you a story about glory and the many paths to it... He then proceeds to tell you that maybe you should find a path of your own...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350203;I shall walk the paths to glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350203;I am happy standing still.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350204;One of your friends gave you an ancient manuscript as a gift. It's a truly remarcable historical text detailing the rise to power of an ancient Emperor called Sargon. Could you actually learn something from his exploits?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350204;Imperial ambition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350204;I am content to read about such things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350205;An old man is brought before you. He is a famous criminal, now finally caught. Before you deliver your verdict, he tells you that nothing great can be achieved in life by those who lack the necessary cruelty to act as needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350205;I will act as needed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350205;Kindness is the true path to greatness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350206;A famous scholar lectures you on the perils of ambition. He declares that with ambition comes the rather unfortunate urge of stepping on others...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350206;I step on others all the time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350206;I do not step!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350207;Two of your courtiers are having a rather heated discussion. They are now trading insults! It seems that the central argument relates to the nature of ambition, and whether ambition at all costs is a virtue or not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350207;Ambition uber alles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350207;Kindness is the greater virtue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350208;A beautiful young noblewoman recounts the tale of a famous courtesan. She tells you how this ancient courtesan managed to find her way to power by using and destroying all of the fools enamored with her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350208;Fools are meant to be used and destroyed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350208;Horrific! Kindness is the better way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC554350209;One of your nobles brings you a most unexpected gift. It is the Eagle of a long forgotten legion! The once proud martial symbol is now slightly battered and one of its wings is missing, yet it still manages to evoke the glory that was Rome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA554350209;I shall use it as my battle standard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB554350209;I am not worthy of such glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
