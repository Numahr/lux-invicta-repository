hist_alexander;Blood of Alexandros;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_alexander_desc;This character is a proud descendant of Megas Alexandros. His son by Roxana, Alexandros IV was a tragic figure, blinded in a childhood accident. Following unrest he retired to Cyprus, where he took little interest in the affairs of the world. The main line of the Argeadai became irrelevant, yet respected rulers of their island kingdom, while the secondary line, descended from Stateira became glorified marriage partners for the daughters of the Diadokhoi. It is said the Conqueror's blood boils with ambition and echoes of Alexandros's thoughts still reverberate through the very spirit of his heirs! The blood keeps whispering to them that they should only weep when there is nothing left to conquer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_ptolemaios;Blood of Ptolemaios;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_ptolemaios_desc;The proud Diadokhoi bloodline of Ptolemaios once ruled over Egypt and the Levant, from Kyrene to Cyprus! As a Roman vassal, Ptolemaic Egypt managed to survive in a reduced state, until finally its rulers had to accept the loss of Egypt and rule over the small kingdom of Kyrene alone. Kyrene became an impregnable bastion of the Ptolemaioi, a highly fortified and developed realm sustained by a powerful professional military, and even Muslim expansion could not dislodge the proud Hellenes from their seat of power. Upon their elevation to the throne, the Ptolemaioi of Kyrene adopt the sacred praenomen of Userkhaenre Meryamun  - Who is made strong through the ka of Re, beloved of Amun- the ancient name of Ptolemaîos Philádelphos, for it was prophesized that He would ride back in glory to Alexandria and beyond!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_gelimer;Blood of Gelimer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_gelimer_desc;Gelimer, King of the Vandals and the Alans, Champion of Arianism defeated Belisarius at Ad Decimum in 533, thus ensuring the survival of the Vandal state. His dream of forging a Carthaginian Empire came very near to fruition. He ruled over a vast state controlling Carthage, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica and Southern Spain, but died assassinated in Carthago Nova, before he could proclaim himself Emperor. The Kings of Carthage slowly lost their Mediterranean conquests, but their vast maritime and commercial power assured their survival, even in the face of Muslim expansion. The blood of Gelimer yearns for revenge and remembers the great King's last words: Roma delenda est...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_seleukos;Blood of Seleukos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_seleukos_desc;Seleukos I Nikator, blood of Apollo, built an Empire and his descendants squandered it. The Seleukidai came close to extinction but the young Antiochus XIII Soter defeated Tigranes near Antiocheia ad Taurus in 83BCE, sparkling the beginning of a Seleukid Renaissance. Antiochus XIII Soter brought Tigranes's Armenian Empire to its knees, then after a series of successful campaigns in the East, he had himself proclaimed a second Alexandros after a triumphal entry into Seleukeia on the Tigris, the ancient capital of Arche Seleukeia. The Seleukid Renaissance ended in 116CE when Antiochus XVI Epiphanes bent the knee before a victorious Trajan and accepted Roman sovereignty. Seleukid Syria survived as a Roman vassal and later became a buffer state between the Romans and Islam. The blood of divine Seleukos is restless and wishes its glory restored!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_sassanid;Blood of Sassan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_sassanid_desc;"From Estakr, Ardashir I, blood of Sassan and Darius the Achaemenid, built an Empire and swore to bring the world under the dominion of Ahura Mazda. The glory of the Realm of Light knew no equal on this world and Kings from Sindhia to the shores of the Inner Sea prostrated themselves before the glory of the Light. Yet Angra Mainyu saw fit to test the steadfastness of the Sovereigns of Light and a great darkness arose from Arabia to challenge the Realm of Ahura Mazda. It was Yazdegird III who stopped those who would destroy the Realm of Light and in 636CE at the Battle of al-Qadisiyyah Ahura Mazda emerged victorious. The Empire was saved, only to fall pray to internal dissension as the centuries weakened the blood of the Sovereigns of Light. Yet, in Estakhr, the blood of Sassan remains strong and the Lords of Light still whisper: ""With me is the Derafsh Kavian, through which I shall rule the nations.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_julianos;Blood of Julian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_julianos_desc;"Flavius Claudius Julianus Augustus, blood of Constantine and Augustus on his mother's side, Sol Invictus made flesh and Savior of the Light, was a true philosopher-king the likes of which the Romans have never seen again. Invincible in battle, Julian humbled all who opposed him, from the barbaric Alamanni and Franks to the Sassanids of Persia. His complete victory over the Christian Infidels and Sacred policies of Purification of the Eastern Empire were an inspiration for many Emperors to come, as Christianity and other barbaric cults were humbled by the Invincible Light of Sol. Although his descendants lost the throne, Aurelian II, the True Restorer of the World, a descendant of the great Aurelian on the maternal side, managed to regain it and on the 25th of December 932CE, the very date of the Dies Natalis Sol Invicti, the Birthday of Sol Invictus, he entered Constantinople in triumph and restored the blood of Julian to its rightful place of Glory. The Sun Emperors of Constantinople dedicate their rule to ""Inventori Lucis Soli Invicto Augusto"" - to the Creator of Light, Sol Invictus Augustus, and await his return, for the Sun will be made flesh once more in the very person of the Emperor and the Light shall banish the Darkness from the world of Man!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_agiad;Blood of Agis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_agiad_desc;The bloodline of Agis I, son of Eurysthenes, blood of Heracles, King of Sparta has provided Lakedaimon with its senior line of kings for milennia. This is Sparta and Sparta does things differently... The city has two kings, called Arkhagetai, with the two dynastic lines descending from the twins Eurysthenes and Procles. These Heraclidae Kings of Sparta are split into the senior Agiad and junior Eurypontid line. Fueled by the Spartan warrior ethos the Kings of Sparta are legendary figures, from the immortal Leonidas and his 300, to Agesilaus II, Basileus of the Hellenes. Molon labe! the Spartans still shout before being asked to surrender as they inevitably meet some superior force on the battlefield...and then proceed to humble it. While its great traditions never died out. Sparta did lose its glory as the star of Makedon rose, but the Lakedaemonians still managed to hold on to their corner of the Peloponesus. The Romans, great admirers of the Spartan militaristic state allowed them to continue as a vassal kingdom, and the Spartans, ever more insular dedicated themselves to martial perfection. The Spartan Homoioi -those who are the same- fought for the Romans in countless battles, many of them in the shade of clouds of arrows fired by Eastern hosts. The Agiads still rule over the city to this day, and upon their ascension to kingship they go on a sacred pilgrimage to Thermopylae, where they recite the famous epigram of Simonides, so that they might remember what it is to be Spartan: O ksein', angellein Lakedaimoniois hoti teide keimetha, tois keinon rhemasi peithomenoi - Go tell the Spartans, stranger passing by, that here obedient to their laws we lie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_karling;Blood of Charlemagne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_karling_desc;Karolus Magnus, King of the Franks and Imperator Romanorum ruled over a vast, yet fragile Empire. A major architect of this Empire was Pope Leo III, exiled from Rome by the proper Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius V, the Pope went to the court of the Frankish King and persuaded him to wage a Crusade against the Unholy Empire now found in Rome. In order to give legitimacy to the enterprise Leo had Karolus crowned Sacred Roman Emperor and proclaimed the birth of a new Holy Roman Empire! The crusading armies of this new Holy Roman Empire marched on Rome, but in 802 at the battle of Pavia, an allied Roman coalition led by the Mithraic host of Ravenna defeated the Franks and sent them back over the Alps. The Empire of Karolus Magnus remained a fragmented theoretical state, and upon his death it split into many lesser kingdoms paying only lip service to the new Sacral Emperor reigning in Aachen. The main Karling line retained the fiction of their Holy Roman Imperial title, but little power outside the walls of their Sacral capital. The lesser lines of the Pepinid Karlings and Lotharing Karlings ruling over Austrasia and Lotharingia retain vastly more power than their theoretical overlord. The Emperor himself is nothing but a shadow of the great Karolus, with the great nobility of his inexistent Empire bowing before him in public, yet laughing behind his back. A Karling Restoration is the dream of every Sacral Emperor, and even the lesser bloodlines of the Karlings share it... yet such a dream might be beyond the powers of mere mortal men. A True Sacred Emperor, Karolus Reborn, might be the only one able to fulfill such glory! Can there be such a One? It is the Karling's sacred destiny to find out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_merovingian;Blood of Merovech;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_merovingian_desc;The Merovingian Kings of Francia trace their descent from Merovech and Clovis I, the first great Christian King of the Franks. Their Holy Sang Real has ruled over the Franks for hundreds of years, although many of those years were spent as figure-heads, with overpowerful Mayors of the Palace being the actual power of the realm. The Karlings kept the Sang Real on a tight leash, the Merovingian Kings being in truth less than minor aristocrats in their new capital of Paris. Providing little besides overglorified marriage partners for the Karlings and other more powerful dynasties, the Merovingians could have dissapeared into complete irrelevance. Yet this was not to be. Following the great fragmentation of the Karling Empire and The Third Great War of the Princes, an able scion of the Sang Real rose to great power among the feudal nobles of the Holy Roman Empire. His name was Clovis VI and through his marriage to the Karling princess Adelheid, a well-engineered network of alliances, and undisputed martial genious, this later-day Clovis rebuilt a kingdom for his sacred bloodline. Under his descendants, this Sacral Frankish Kingdom became ever more of a theocracy than a feudal state. The Kings of the Sang Real are considered Holy by their subjects and are said to be able to ritually cure sickness by laying on hands. Ever greater belief in their Sacred Mission meant the Merovingians split with Rome establishing their own Gallic Church, based upon the Mystery of the Sang Real and the divine destiny of its heirs. It is said that a Ruler of the Holy Blood will one day rule the world, for the world belongs to the Sacred Sang Real, now and forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_capet;Blood of Hugh Capet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_capet_desc;"The Capetians trace their descent from Robert the Strong, the first of their line to ascend the throne of Neustria. As Sovereign-Margrave of Neustria, Robert was one of the great feudal lords of the Empire, and following the collapse of Karling power during The First Great War of the Princes, he had himself crowned King. Following his successes in battle against the Vikings, Robert became known as the Strong and he would come to sire a long line of Kings. In spite of his greatness, the dynasty of Neustria now takes its name after Hugh Capet, one of his descendants. This is a result of Hugh's ephemereal elevation as High King of the Franks during his victorious war against the Karling kingdoms. Wielding the Sacred Oriflamme banner of Saint Denis, after having been gifted the banner by his ally, the Merovingian Charibert VIII, the very image of a Warrior King, Hugh led the armies of Neustria to countless victories. Fittingly in 996, Hugh died in battle, surrounded, yet never surrendering, cut down by his own treacherous nobles, even in death still holding on to the sacred Oriflamme banner, and thus ascending into legend. The Kings of Neustria honor his legacy as they go into battle shouting: ""Montjoie! Saint Denis!"" their Host following the Sacred Oriflamme to glory!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_barcelona;Blood of Bello;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_barcelona_desc;The bloodline of Bello, Lord of Carcassonne since 790 until his death in 810, his descendants, the Bellonids ruled over vast lands in Septimania and Catalonia. The Bellonids became hereditary rulers of the short-lived Spanish March, and under Wilfred the Hairy, Lord of Barcelona, the former territories of the March were reorganized into a powerful Principality. The proud symbol of the Bellonids, the Senyera, the golden flag with four red stripes of the House of Barcelona dates back to Wilfred's participation in the failed Spanish Crusade of Karolus the Bold. Following a great victory against the infidels, the wounded Frankish King smeared four bloodied fingers over Wilfred's golden shield thus giving birth to the eternal symbol of the Catalans. The proud Lords of Barcelona carry the Seyera into battle to this day, ready to add their blood to the golden shield of Wilfred!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_decebal;Blood of Decebalus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_decebal_desc;Decebalus, The Brave, King of Dacia, ruled over a vast Dacian state from his great capital of Sarmizegetusa. In 87CE Decebalus destroyed 5 Roman legions at the battle of Tapae, thus earning himself the eternal enmity of Rome. Trajan defeated Decebalus in 102CE and Dacia had to become a client kingdom. As a client of Rome, Dacia became a militaritic buffer state of the Empire, and a recruiting ground for its legions. The Dacians owe their survival to the peculiar nature of their society. As a military client of the Empire, the Dacian state became increasingly more dedicated to warfare. The tarabostes, the warrior nobility, became a meritocratic class whose sole purpose was turned to martial excellence. The Cult of Zalmoxis became a monotheistic religion, with its disciples believing in an afterlife most easily earned by valor in battle. Zamolxianism became the religion of the state, and this warrior-mystical religion helped turn the Dacians into an unconquerable and fearless martial people. The Dacians hold death in contempt, and their fanatic falxmen expect their glorious place in the afterlife in every battle. Every year the Dacians send a warrior to Zalmoxis with their petitions, as he fearlessly throws himself from a great height onto the spears of the assembled host. It is said that Zalmoxis hears this supreme prayer and sends glorious thunder to signal his acceptance of his people's supplication. After gaining the approval of Heaven, the Dacian hosts march behind their Draco banners to the glory none can deny them! Woe to the enemies of Zalmoxis, for the Blood of Decebalus fear nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hist_brian_desc;Brian Bóruma mac Cennétig, King of Munster was the last Irishman to hold the High Kinghsip of Hibernia. After several succesfull campaigns Brian received the submission of all of the Kings of the island, from the ruthless Norse Ivarrings of Dublin to the proud Conchobairs of Connacht. In a sacred ceremony on the Holy Hill of Tara, Brian drank the royal ale, and married the goddess Medb. It is said that as the ceremony came to a close Brian touched the Lia Fáil, the Stone of Destiny, and the stone sang, as it had not since time of Cúchulainn! As the rightful king of Ireland, Brian should have enjoyed a long and prosperous reign, but it was not to be. In 1014, at the Battle of Clontarf, Brian led his Fianna Fáil, his warriors of Destiny, against a vast Norse host, and while his army emerged victorious their rightful king fell to treachery. It is said that in Sacred Tara the Lia Fáil roared with sorrow, and that since then it has fallen silent once more. Maybe it will come to be, that one day another king of the blood of Brian will become Ard Ri of Hibernia, and go on to Tara so the Stone may roar again! Until then the Lia Fáil is waiting in silence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_oleg;Blood of Oleg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_oleg_desc;"Oleg the Seer, the first Great Varangian Prince of Kiev is a figure of legend, credited with great oracular powers. In 912 Oleg, Bane of the Rhomaion, assembled a great Varangian host and went South to besiege Miklagard itself. Unable to penetrate the great walls of the Imperial City, Oleg fixed his shield to the gate of the city. It is said that a prophecy foretold that Oleg would find his death from his own stallion, and so he sent it away, and many years later when the horse had died, he finally went to see its remains. As Oleg touched the skull of his stallion, a snake slithered from inside the skull and bit him. Thus Oleg died fulfilling the prophecy. His descendants are still credited with great oracular power, and are prone to call themselves ""The Seer Princes"" of Kiev. While their dominion is much diminished the Olegovichs of Kiev are still feared by their enemies as they cling on to power in the Seer's capital. The Princes of Kiev have overcome many misfortuners, and have remained steadfast in their resolve, for it is foretold that one day, a King of the Blood of Oleg will march once more on Miklagard and he will affix his shield on the very doors of the Imperial Palace!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_rurik;Blood of Rurik;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_rurik_desc;Rurik, the Varangian Prince of Holmgardr established a strong Norse state centered around his newly founded capital. One of many Varangian warlords to try their hand at conquest in the East, Rurik's legacy proved to be the most lasting. His heir Ingvar of Holmgardr was acknowledged by the other Varangian Princes as King of Gardariki. His great Varangian host besieged Miklagard on two ocassions in 941 and 944. Not content with his exploits on the Black Sea, Ingvar terrorized the Caspian as well, his Varangians launching a major expedition into Persia and sacking the great city of Arsakia Rhagae. Inspite of his glorious exploits, Ingvar met with an undignified end, as the Drevlyans captured him while attempting to collect tribute. The Drevlyans bent down two birch trees to the ground and tied them to Ingvar's legs, and then they let the trees straighten, thus tearing him apart. His wife Olga extracted merciless revenge, burning their capital of Iskorosten and then salting its very ground, then leveling their other towns so that nothing remained of them, while all Drevlyan men were put to the sword. Rurik's blood lost the High Kingship, but his descendants continued to reign in Holmgardr and elsewhere. After several expeditions to Miklagard, and with many of their warriors having served in the Rhomaion Varangian Guard, the Princes of Holmgardr adopted Ódinn-Sól as their patron, their very own version of Sol Invictus. It is their dream to build a great Empire of the North, a Third Rome under the auspices of their Invincible Sun, and then one day with the whole might of Gardariki descend upon Miklagard in victory and march on to even greater glory, to Rome and beyond!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_parmenion;Blood of Parmenion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_parmenion_desc;"Parmenion, the great general of Philip II of Makedon, and then Megas Alexandros, was one of the greatest of the Makedones. The chief companion of Philip, and then Alexandros's second in command, Parmenion's great wisdom inspired generations of Makedon generals. While some whisper that his steadfast command of the left at the Battle of Issus was the true key to success in that most famous of battles, others choose to remember him for his advice before the battle of Gaugamela. Darius had sent an emissary offering Alexandros half of his entire empire in exchange for peace... Parmenion opined that if he were Alexander, he would have gladly accepted the offer. Alexander only replied, ""And I would too, if I were Parmenion."" The bloodline of Parmenion became Satraps of Ecbatana and stubbornly held on to it as they mastered the art of bowing before the most powerful ruler of the day. Their greatest moment came towards the end of the Seleukid Renaissance. In 102CE Philotas XII, after a famous victory near Arsakia Rhagae, humbled his Parthian Overlord and went on to crown himself King of Media. After a series of whirlwind campaigns, Philotas, now king of Media, Atropatene and Hayasdan marched upon Seleukeia on the Tigris and entered the city in triumph as the Seleukid Basileus Antiochus XVI Epiphanes chose not to give battle. Great celebrations were planned to mark the Restauration of a Hellenic Persian Empire, but on that very night Philotas XII the Conqueror, died chocking on a poisoned cup of wine, and the dream of a restored Arche Makedonia died with him. His descendants did well to hold on to Ecbatana and wither the storms time sent their way. Now Persianized the Parmenions of Ecbatana still hold on to their Satrapy and dream of the Empire that could have been, if not but for a cup of wine!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hist_artorius_desc;"The general Lucius Artorius, commander of the Sarmatian Cavalry of Alexandros III, was the bastard son of King Abgar IX of Osroene. In 207 CE, Lucius Artorius was sent at the head of a great Daco-Sarmatian army to Britannia to defeat the Republicans under Clodius Albinus. His defeat of the Republicans in the great battle of Londinium, and the trampling of the body of Clodius Albinus, still clutching the SPQR banner remain the stuff of legend. Alexandros III would fondly call him ""The True Destroyer of the Republic"". His subsequent defeat of the Caledoni and the sacrifice of their King Circennos by his Sarmatian cavalrymen having a Sword of Victory dedicated to the War God thrust in the ground through the still beating heart of the King, would only add to the Artorian myth. Wielding his Sword of Victory Lucius Artorius went on to campaign beyond the Wall, reaching the Northern End of the World, as no civilized man had done before him. Lucius Artorius was later named hereditary Supreme Military governor of Britannia, and his power over the Island was enforced by a vast programme of Daco-Sarmatian colonization. In 259 his descendant Maximus Artorius proclaimed himself Emperor of Britannia, and would go on to become Gallic Emperor and co-Emperor of the Roman Empire. In 500 CE, another Artorian, Magnus Artorius, High King of Britannia won the great Brython victory of Mons Badonicus over the Saxon invaders, thus stopping their Western advance. In 537, he would die killed in sigle combat by his own son Mordred, during the Battle of Camlann. The Artorii would go on to produce many High Kings of the Brythons and lesser kings as well. The senior Sarmato-Brython branch of the family took up the name Pendragon - ""Head Dragon"" - as their Sarmatian Dragon Banners became the symbol of the dynasty. Another symbol of the dynasty remains Lucius Artorius's Sword of Victory, the true symbol of Artorian kingship. Each Artorian King is supposed to sacrifice at least one man to the Sword of the War God throughout his reign in order to be recognized as a True King. The greater the rank of the sacrificed man, the Greater the King, the legend goes, and many great men of Britannia saw their end with the Sword of Victory thrust into the ground through their beating heart. While the power of the Artorii is much diminished, men still tremble at the very sight of the invincible Dragon Banners! It is said that a True King wielding the Sword of Victory will once more humble the West and show himself to the world by having an Emperor sacrificed to the War God.

With the support of the East behind him, Vespasian emerged victorious during the Year of the Four Emperors, after Alexandros II had been assassinated by his Nabatean mistress Salome. His son Titus, who would go on to become Emperor himself, subdued Judea, conquered Jerusalem and captured the Jewish fortress of Massada. In 73 CE Vespasian was responsible for the first wave of Jewish resettlement in the Sinai. The last words of the great Emperor, one last joke at the Divine Alexandros II's expense were: ""I think I am turning into a God."" The Vespasiani lost the Imperial throne, but managed to survive as one of the great Roman patrician families. The star of the Vespasiani rose once more in 895 CE as Leo VI the Macedonian appointed Lucius Vespasianus as hereditary Exarch of the restored Exarchate of Africa. The Vespasiani have remained in control of their African dominion ever since, still dreaming of their restoring their line to Imperial glory.

In 692 Kahina destroyed a great Islamic army near Biskra and had all captives decapitated, their bodies left to rot on the field. This earned her the dread name of ""Gatherer of Heads"" among the Arabs. Furthermore in 695 Kahina defeated the great Islamic general Hasan ibn al-Numan greatly weakening Islam in North Africa. The Queen swore never to rest till Islam had not been purged from Africa. In 710 CE, the Kahinid prince Amnay founded the Kingdom of Nekor and her descendants have ruled it ever since. Unbent and unbroken, the Berber Kings of Nekor are reputed for their invincible exploits on the battlefield and their talent for sorcery.

His reign as co-Emperor began inauspiciously as Lucius Verus was forced to pay the Praetorian Guard a donative of 20,000 sestertii per capita in exchange for an oath of loyalty. His reign proceeded smoothly after this, and Lucius Verus became much loved by the people, as he lacked Imperial pomp and mingled with them freely. He instituted several programs aimed at taking care of poor children and integrating them from an early age within the military structure of the Empire. He allowed free speech, and was said to enjoy comedians who managed to mock him in intelligent fashion. Lucius Verus proved to be invincible on the battlefield, winning several battles for the Empire, in a quick efficient manner. In his later years, he turned to luxury, gambling and orgies, while still managing to fulfill his duties with great efficiency. He took the divinely beautiful Panthea as a mistress, whose influence over him was so great that comedians came to call him Panthea. The Emperor took this in good humor. Lucius Verus also became known as an avid collector of fossils and ""bones of giants"" and earned a reputation of a pleasure loving scholar, entertaining his guests with his knowledge and magnificent orgies. The other great Verus, Lucius Verus II was one of the greatest martial Emperors, sadly remembered by most only for his execution of the widow of Alexandros IV, Aquilia Severa. The Former Vestal virgin was buried alive according to Roman custom once Lucius took power. Her son Alexandros V would later forgive him, proclaiming it to have been ""the Roman way"". In 428 CE the magnate Quintus Verus was appointed hereditary military governor of Provincia, thus inaugurating the centuries long Veri rule over Provinica.

In 34 BCE, Amyntas received the submission of Armenia, and in 32 BCE became Sovereign of Atropatene. His legendary campaign against Parthia was crowned by his defeat of Phraates IV near Hecatompylos. His Tindotae are said to have refused to emasculate the Parthian dead after considering them ""not manly enough to be worth the trouble."" Amyntas entered Hecatompylos in triumph and had himself acclaimed King of Kings. 7 days later he was dead, in mysterious circumstances, and with him died the dream of a Galatian Empire to rival Alexandros's. His descendants continued to rule in Galatia and proved to be major players in Imperial politics as their warlike state became a source of great military strength for those who could command its loyalty. The proud warlike Galatians were also widely used as military colonists throughout the known world, and their heritage can be found from the Pillars of Hercules to Helleno-China. The adoption of the cult of Eosphorus, the Dawn Bringer as the state religion of the Kingdom further strenghtened this unbreakable people. Eosphorus, Lucifer, the True Lord of Hosts commands his subjects to carry on his eternal battle against the False Gods of Darkness, who would enslave Man, subject him to countless indignities and condemn him to eternal servitude, gods such as Yahweh or his son the so-called Christ.

He humbled the Armenian Emperor and had him result his role as a petty client of Rome. Following his victories in the East Severus was sent to Hispania to put down a Lusitanian rebellion. In 192 CE, following the death of Commodus, his legions procalimed him Emperor in Hispania. He became a member of the Imperial Triumvirate alongside Clodius Albinus and Alexandros III, his control over Hispania and Africa being confirmed. In 200 CE, while in Rome, Septimius Severus attempted to have himself crowned sole Emperor, and after the refusal of the Senate, he had it disbanded thus sparking the War of the Three Emperors. The Great Champion of the Republicans, Clodius Albinus expelled Severus from Rome and then chased him into Hispania. At the end of the war in 210 CE Alexandros III acknowledged Septimius Severus as Emperor of Hispania, thus starting the long rule of the Severi over their Hispanic possessions, and inaugurating the long lived political entity of the Empire of Hispania. On his deathbed Severus told his sons Geta and Caracalla: ""Be harmonious, make sure to enrich the soldiers, and scorn all other men."" and the Severi have taken this to heart, managing to survive the centuries on pure military strength alone. The Severi slowly lost their hold over Hispania, and in 553 CE Valentia submmited to Belisarius. Justinian had Marius Severus confirmed as hereditary Exarch of Valentia, and thus the once proud Emperors became the unbreakable Exarchs of the West. The Empire of Hispania lived on, as many Gothic High Kings claimed the title for their own. In 707 CE Julius Severus broke off with the Empire proclaiming himself King of Valentia, and the Severi became once more masters of an independent power. Having survived many centuries of adversity, Vandals, Goths and the Rise of Islam, the Severi still hold on to their Kingdom of Valentia and dream of the Empire that is rightfully theirs. With the Immortal Legio VI Hispana at their command, and their great militaristic state ready to raise more legions for their masters, the Severi are ready to once more claim the Empire of Hispania as their own, and if Mithra is willing one day return to Rome and punish the Senate for its ancient, yet never forgiven insolence!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_muawiyah;Blood of Muawiyah;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_muawiyah_desc;"This character is a descendant of Muawiyah ibn Abi Sufyan, the first Umayyad Caliph. In 657 CE Muawiyah fought Ali in the great Battle of Siffin, a key moment in the dissolution of Islamic unity. The arbitration following the indecisive battle, spelled the beginning of the End for the Rashidun Caliphate. Following Ali's assassination by a Kharijite, Muawiyah became Caliph and ruled over much of the Islamic Realm from Damascus. In 670 CE, Alexandros XVI entreated him to attack Persia, wishing to see him humbled in the process, but his plan backfired as Muawiyah conquered Ctesiphon and had the Persians expelled from Mesopotamia. Alexandros famously proclaimed: ""Never trust a Persian to do your business."" The later years of his rule so the Great Fragmentation of Islam and collapse of any form of central authority. He died assassinated in 680, his death causing further Islamic disunity. In 750 CE Umayyad power in the East collapsed entirely following their defeat in the Battle of the Zab by the new Abbasid Caliphate. The Umayyad Caliph Marwan II barely managed to flee to Damascus and retain rule over the city and its environs. In 755 CE, the Umayyad Abd-ar-Rahman went to Hispania, thus inaugurating the Great Umayyad adventure in the West, culminating in the Establishment of the Caliphate of Cordoba. The Umayyads went on to become great patrons of Ilm, their realms being renowned for their tolerance, scientific advances and patronage of art. The Umayyads might have lost their former glory, but as patrons of Light in a world of Darkness, they still hope that one day they will regain what is rightfully theirs. Maybe, a day will come when Ilm will be the guiding principle of Islam once more, and the Umayyad Caliphs will once more be the focus of the prayers of the faithful, from Mecca to Cordoba and beyond!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hist_calgacus_desc;"Calgacus, High King of the Caledoni is a legend among his people. The Great King achieved the impossible - he united the disparate tribes of the North, to fight their common enemy - Rome. Even Tacitus acknowledged him as ""the most distinguished and valorous of the chieftains"". His speech before the Battle of Mons Graupius became part of the mythology of the Peoples of the North. He told them that: ""Here at the very end of the Earth slavery is a thing unknown, and we would do well to die as free men rather than be the slaves of Rome."" He famously finished his discourse by declaring that ""the Romans make a desert and call it peace"", a saying often repeated throughout history. Calgacus died that day with honor, surrounded, yet never surrendering, prefering death to slavery. The Peoples of the North and his descendants remember his example to this very day, and they remain unbent and unbroken, the true Free People on the Edge of the World!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_theodemir;Blood of Theodemir;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_theodemir_desc;This character is a descendant of the Amali High King Theodemir, the father of the Great Theodoric, and sire of several long lines of Kings. The Blood of Theodemir ruled many kingdoms from the Balkans to Hispania, and found its way into many dynasties on the maternal line. While Theodoric went West, several branches of the family remained in the east. The Blood of Theodemir retained the High Kingship of the Balkan Ostrogoths, and in 504 CE Leo II created the Kingdom of Diocleia for his Ostrogothic clients. The Kingdom of Diocleia became the primary Ostrogothic recruiting ground for the Empire, these Eastern Goths found themselves fighting under the Imperial Banner in battlefields ranging from Hispania to Persia. Their proud warrior culture and excellence in the art of war saw them settled as military colonists throughout the Empire, wherever a Gothic sword was needed. The Blood of Theodemir retain the martial spirit of their ancestors and remain unconquered in their strongholds on the Adriatic Sea. The Theodemirings no longer serve the Empire, and are now free to find their own glory! They still remember the Great High Kings of Old and know that Rome was once humbled by the Goths, and it can be so again. Their will is iron, their resolve steel and their desire unending!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_hengist;Blood of Hengist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_hengist_desc;"This character is a descendant of the 5th century Saxon warlord Hengist. Hengist was one of the leaders of the Germanic invasion of Britannia, and eventually the first King of the British Saxons. He is widely considered to be the ""Father of the Country"" by the Saxons of the Island and all Saxon kings without fail trace their lineage to him in some manner. While Hengist could not acquire much land from the Brythons, barely holding dominion over what would later become Kent, he remained infamous for the ""Brad y Cyllyll Hirion"" - the Treachery of the Long Knives. At a famous council meeting, Hengist had several British sub-kings and lords treacherously murdered, after his supposedly unarmed Saxons hid knives in their shoes. In spite of his treacherous ways, Hengist managed to hold on to his territories in South Eastern England and Britannia was changed forever! His bloodline would go on to sire a great many Kings, both saintly and murderous, but none without ambition, for ambition burns within their very blood!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_aelle;Blood of Aelle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_aelle_desc;This character is a descendant of Aelle, first King of the South Saxons. In 478 CE, Aelle established his dominion over Suthseaxna, and then went on to be acknowledged as High King by most of the Saxons of Britannia. Aelle alternated between a policy of war and diplomacy towards the Brythons, which would ultimately prove disastrous. In 515 CE Aelle was captured by a contingent of Artorian Sarmatian cavalry and used for target practice. His body, pierced by countless arrows was left to rot for days before it was found by his Saxon followers. His descendants the Aellings remian one of the most prestigious royal families of the Saxons to this day. His bloodline held on to Sussex and also provided the British Saxons with several High Kings. While their power is much diminished, a worthy heir of Aelle could still rise once more to the High Kingship, and maybe one day even avenge his ancestor by repaying the Sarmato-Brythons for the ancient murder of their sire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_aescwine;Blood of Aescwine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_aescwine_desc;This character is a descendant of Aescwine, first King of the East Saxons.In 527 CE, Aescwine established his dominion over what would become Essex, one of the traditional kingdoms of the Saxons. Aescwine held dominion over his people, partly on behalf of his illustrious lineage, for he claimed direct descent from Seaxneat, the ancient Forefather-King-God of the Saxons. Claiming senior right of blood over the rest of the Kings of the Saxons his descendants often vied for the title of Bretwalda, and often met with success in their endeavors. Known for their diplomatic prowess, the heirs of Aescwine proved worthy of their forefather, yet in spite of all their skill and power their dominion dwindled, for a wave of new Conquerors evicted them from much of their lands. The Norse now reign in their ancient capital of Londinium, and this is something the blood of Aescwine can not tolerate! A King of their Blood must set this wrong aright, and have the ancient Holy Blood of the Saxons returned to their rightful capital and place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_raedwald;Blood of Raedwald;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_raedwald_desc;"This character is a descendant of Raedwald, the great King of East Anglia. Raedwald was the first Sovereign to be called ""High King of the Angles"" rather than the Saxons, after proclaiming himself High King of Eastern Britannia in 599 CE. His ambition of turning all of Britannia into one unified kingdom collapsed following the battle of Wantage in 603 CE. Defeated by Riothamus II Artorius, the High King of the Brythons the two acknowledged each other as High Kings, one ruling over the West, the other over the East. Raedwald's conversion to Christianity would have disastrous consequences in terms of his power over the Saxons. In 610 CE Oswald of Northumbria proclaimed himself High King of the Saxons and Raedwald was forced to fight an indecisive war effectively losing sovereignty over the North. Raedwald's descendants held on to power in East Anglia, and his blood is often blamed by many to this very day for eventually causing the division of the Saxon High Kingship and the appearence of the High Kingdom of the North. The Raedwaldings remain a powerful, yet embiterred dynasty, still clinging to their dream of reuniting the Saxon lands and expelling all invaders from their ancestral High Kingdom.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_oswald;Blood of Oswald;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_oswald_desc;This character is a descendant of Oswald the Great, the Divine Ruler and King of Northumbria. Oswald was a man of great ambition. His claim of being the Son of God, his unequalled charisma and his merging of Christian and pagan beliefs into a powerful royal cult, turned many nobles to his cause. His campaigns of unification brought the North under his rule and in 610 CE, Oswald proclaimed himself Bretwalda, fighting an indecisive war with Raedwald of East Anglia over the High Kingship. This war would prove to be the beginning of the end for the unity of the High Kingdom of the Saxons. Widely acknowledged as the Divine Ruler of the North, Oswald managed to became Bretwalda in truth in 632 CE. Following his death, his body remained uncorrupt. With his divinity proven, Oswald's remains became the focus of an important Saxon cult, his descendants later carrying his Invincible Right hand into battle as a relic guaranteeing victory. In 650 CE the split between the South and North would become permanent, as his descendant Oswiu of Northanhymbra, supported by the Britano-Sarmatian High King Riothamus III Artorius, proclaimed himself High King of the North, thus splitting Saxon dominions in half, creating the long lasting status-quo of the Three Kingdoms in Britannia. The Divine Blood of the Oswaldings is seen by many to this very day as the rightful Ruling Blood of the North, and the heirs of Oswald still dream of carrying their ancestor's Hand into glorious battle, to reestablish their rightful dominion over the North and beyond!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_offa;Blood of Offa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_offa_desc;"This character is a descendant of Offa the Good, the King of Mercia. With his Kingdom bordering the Brython lands, Offa decided to ally himself with his Western neighbors and in 757 CE he married the Artorian princess Axyra. The Offaning line thus became to be known by many as the ""Saxon Artorii"". Following an elaborate diplomatic policy Offa of Mercia managed to become Bretwalda of the Saxons in 765 CE. He would rule in peace establishing good relations with the High Kings of Brythonia and Northanhymbra. Mostly concerning himself with internal affairs, Offa established a great system of burghs within his realm, while his monetary policies saw his coins being used in international commerce, his gold coins making their way as far East as the Abbasid Caliphate! Offa the Good died assassinated by his own son Ecgfrith, who would come to lose the High Kingship and his life on account of his later proven patricide. The Offanings rule over Mercia to this day, accused by some to be more Brython than Saxon, the Kings of Mercia have intermarried into the Brython noble families and are seen by many to be more Artorii than anything else. They are renowned for their great administrative skills, and many believe that an Offaning High King might one day bring back the prosperity of old to Britannia and beyond!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_urien;Blood of Urien;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_urien_desc;This character is a descendant of Urien Rheged, King of Rheged and Sovereign Lord of the Hen Ogledd. One of the legendary Battle-Leaders of the Brythons, Urien of Rheged imposed his authority over the Old North and was acknowledged as High King by the Brythons of the Hen Ogledd. Invincible in battle and widely respected by the Brythons, Urien married the Artorian princess Morgana, and together they would sire a long line of kings. Morgana would later kill her husband and rule as Queen in her own right over Rheged and the Men of the North. While it is said that the Saxons of the South are steel, the Men of the North are stone. Unconquered and unbreakable the Kings of Rheged wish to restore their dominion over the Hen Ogledd and banish the Norse and the Saxons into the Sea. With the Blood of Urien and Artorius in their veins, the true Kings of the North are prophesiezed to regain their High Kingship and bring the dominion of the Gwyr y Gogledd - the Men of the North - over all of the great Islands of the West!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_maelgwn;Blood of Maelgwn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_maelgwn_desc;This character is a descendant of Maelgwn ap Cadwallon, King of Gwynedd and High King of the Brythons. Maelgwn remains a legendary character among the Brythons, partly because of Taliesin the Bard, his son-in-law and court bard. Immortalized in the great songs of the Brythons, Maelgwn is widely remembered as the High Dragon of the North, and Great King of the Hen Ogledd. An Artorian and Constantinid on the maternal lines, Maelgwn was one of the chief supporters of Christianity in Brythonia. His support of Christianity turned the Pagan Brythons against him, and the Dragon of the Island found his death at the hand of the Pagan priesthood, burned alive as a sacrifice to the old gods. His descendants turned Gwynedd into a bastion of Christianity, while still allowing the druids of Ynis Mon their traditional rights over the Island. The Kings of Gwynedd might not be considered a great power among the Kings of the Island, but their strongholds remain impregnable, from this position of strength they can safely plot the downfall of their many enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_mathrafal;Blood of Rhodri;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_mathrafal_desc;This character is a descendant of Rhodri ap Mawr, the Great, King of Powys and High King of the Brythons. An Artorian of the Royal line of Powys, Rhodri proved worthy of his blood winning many famous victories over the Norse. He was rewarded for his victories and the sacrifice of 101 Norse prisoners to a Sword of Victory, in the ancient Artorian fashion, by being elected High King of the Brythons. Ever impulsive and fearless, Rhodri died in battle against the Norse after charging their line alone, with his troops refusing to fight a greatly superior enemy. His death would inspire his army to victory and the name of Rhodri the Great would become a rallying cry against any subsequent Norse invasion. His senior bloodline rule over Powys, from the ancient seat of their power, the great stronghold of Mathrafal, seat of the High Kings of Old. They remain unconquerable and true to their ancestor's blood, as they bow to no man, no matter his power or earthly glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_artgal;Blood of Artgal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_artgal_desc;This character is a descendant of Artgal of Alt Clut, King of Ystrad Clud and High King of the Hen Ogledd. Known by the Brythons as the Great Artorius of the North, Artgal of Alt Clut ruled over a vast kingdom centered around his great fortress of Dun Breatainn, the oldest stronghold still standing in all of the Islands! His endless wars against the Picts ruined his kingdom, and while the Picts could not overcome him, the great fortress of Dun Breatainn fell after a great siege by the Norse. The Brythons withstood the Norse for 4 months, but in the end the wells of the castle dried out. Rather than surrender the Great King Artgal and his followers died of thirst, defiance on their lips to the very bitter end! His bloodline survived this trial and remain to this day the proudest of Kings, ruling over the Northern bastion of the Brythons, the Kingdom of Ystrad Clud. These proud Artorii of the North have proved their mettle time and time again, and none can deny that given the right circumstances they are capable of once more ruling over the great Hen Ogledd. Woe to their enemies! The Kings of Ystrad Clud know not the meaning of defeat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_samo;Blood of Samo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_samo_desc;"This character is a descendant of Samo the Great, the First High King and Emperor of the Western Slavs. Samo was not a Slav, but a merchant of Frankish descent. As a supplier of weapons to the Slavs, and as a result of his great personal charisma, Samo came to be elected as High King by the Slavs of Moravia and Slovakia, in their attempt to unite against the Avars. Samo increased his authority over the Western Slavic lands by marrying the daughters of many Slavic princes. He had over twelve wives and fathered twenty two legitimate sons and fifteen daughters by his wives. His progeny by concubines or lovers is myriad! This true father of Western Slavic royalty managed to unite the Western Slavs into their own primitive version of an Empire, a great state that would later come to be called Great Moravia. Humbling all who would oppose him, from the Avars to the Germans and the Franks, Samo crowned himself Emperor in immitation of the Romans, and proved to be an inspiration for many later Slavic monarchs, in truth most descending from him, if only on the maternal side. His descendants squandered his legacy and lost their ""Empire"" and thus turned to the worship of Veles in their great bitterness. The Samonids of Nyitra are greatly feared by their enemies, for they know no mercy or restraint! Even their Ahrimanist Avar neighbors know that to anger the Samonids is something not to be done! The Samonids are more than glad to sacrifice their beaten enemies to their Cruel God, ever beseaching him to grant their Return to the Great Glory of Old! Their enemies should beware, for the Blood of Samo can never be extinguished!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_cerdic;Blood of Cerdic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_cerdic_desc;This character is a descendant of Cerdic, the first King of Wessex. The establishment of Wessex started in 495 CE when Cerdic and his son Cynric began to slowly drive out the Brythons from the area that would later become the most famous Kingdom of the Saxons. Claiming descent from Woden himself, the Cerdicing kings of Wessex remained staunchly pagan refusing to convert to Christianity. While the Cerdicing kings consider themselves to be the rightful Bretwaldas of the Saxons, their power has fluctuated over the centuries. Many consider Alfred, Bretwalda of the Saxons to be the greatest of the Cerdicing kings, as a result of his victory in 878 CE over Gutrhum the Danish King of the Danelaw. His defeat of the Danes at Ethandun put an effective end to the expansion of the Danes into Western Britannia. A less fondly remembered Cerdicing is Edward the Martyr, the one Christian King of Wessex. His repeated attempts at converting his subjects failed miserably and earned him his death in 978 CE, when he was assassinated by his brother the pagan Aethelred, a deed met with great approval by the people. The West Saxons know that they are ruled by the Blood of Woden, and they would never tolerate such blasphemy! The Cerdicings of Wessex remember their divine heritage and uppon their ascension as Kings of the West Saxons are required to swear an Oath to drive the Christians into the Sea. While many Kings have failed this Oath so far, who is to say that a future King of Wessex might not succeed where the others have failed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_wisimar;Blood of Wisimar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_wisimar_desc;This character is a descendant of Wisimar, one of the great early High Kings of the Hasdingi Vandals. The blood of Wisimar provided many Vandal kings throughout history and continues to do so to this day. In 550 CE Gaiseric, a Vandal prince in control of territories on both sides of the Pillars of Hercules submitted to Belisarius and was confirmed as the first Vandal client King of Tingis. The powerful Vandal kingdom of Tingis proved to be an effective barrier against the expansion of Islam until 700 CE, when Godigisel II of Tingis assassinated his father and converted to Islam, in order to receive the support of Musa bin Nusair and his Islamic army. The Wisimarid Kings of Tingis were thus directly responsible for opening the door to the expansion of Islam into Hispania. Their control over the Pillars of Hercules and their powerful fleet means that the Wisimarids of Tingis are one of the greatest commercial powers of the Mediterranean if not the world. The blood of Wisimar hold the other Vandal princes in contempt, considering even the Kings of Carthage to be below them in their estimation. From their great stronghold of Tingis the Wisimarids plan to expand their dominion over the Mediterranean and beyond, for they know full well that their invincible fleet can bring them the glory they so richly deserve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Several of the Kings of Dál Riata managed to be accepted as High Kings of Alba and ruled over the entire Northern part of the Island, if only in name. The greatest King of the blood of Gabráin, Áedán mac Gabráin tried to unify Alba, Hibernia and the Hen Ogledd into one great Northern State. His initial efforts were succesful as he came to dominate vast lands from Northern Hibernia to Ystrad Clud. In 603 CE, at the Battle of Degsastan, the self proclaimed High King of all the North met with defeat against a coallition of the Southern Lords. Áedán, refusing to abandon his dream died on the battlefield, it said after suffering no less than 33 wounds! While the power of the Gabrains was broken, their dream was not. The Kings of Dál Riata might seem like nothing more than petty kings to some, but they still remember their glorious ancestors and their sacred dream of a united North! As long as the Blood of Gabrán still flows in their veins, their dream is not dead, only dormant, ready to return in glory once the right King ascends their ancient throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hist_findlaech_desc;This character is a descendant of Findláech mac Ruaidrí, King of Moray and Fortriu. Findláech, King of Moray managed to become King of Fortriu and after several campaigns throughout the North he was acknowledged as High King of Alba. His rule was ephemereal, as he died at the hands of his own son Mac Bethad, Ri Deircc - the Red King. Mac Bethad would in turn become High King of Alba after assassinating all those who would oppose him. Widely accused of using witchcraft in order to further his ambitions, Mac Bethad openly took the title of The Witch King of Fortriu. Several lesser kings are said to have died as a result of his witchery, and even Duncan, the King of Alba is said to have succumbed to his unholy powers. Being true to his blood, his son Mac Bethad II assassinated his own father, also taking to the title of Witch King of Fortriu with relish. While the Blood of Findláech might have lost the High Kingship, their terrible reputation and fearful powers might very well help restore them to their rightful throne. Their enemies know that to defy them is to court death, for the evils the Blood of Findláech can unleash upon their enemies are legion! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_britconstantine;Blood of Constantine of Britannia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_britconstantine_desc;"This character is a descendant of Constantine the Great, of Britannia, Slayer of Emperors. In 315 CE, Constantine of Britannia, the son of Emperor Constantine, founder of Constantinople, and grandson of the Julio-Argead princess Helena, was married to the Artorian princess Axara and made hereditary military governor of Dumnonia by his father in order to weaken the Artorian hold on Britannia. In 330 CE Constantine passed over his son as co-Emperor naming Maxentius II as co-Emperor in control of Gallia. Constantine of Britannia rebelled and defeated Maxentius II in a great battle outside Londinium. In 337 CE while campaigning in Britannia against his son, the Emperor Constantine was captured in a surprise night attack by his son's Sarmatian cavalrymen. Constantine of Britannia asked his father to appoint him as co-Emperor and successor and Constatine I refused, declaring he would rather die instead. His enraged son had his father executed in the Sarmatian fashion, a Sword of Victory dedicated to the War God thrust through his heart into the earth. In 340 CE, Constantine of Britannia defeated another Imperial invasion of Britannia in a great battle outside Aquae Sulis. Thinking his mortally wounded brother the Emperor Constantine II should not be wasted, he had his Sarmatians sacrifice him to his Sword of Victory, now dedicated with the blood of two Emperors. In 342 CE Constantine of Britannia invaded Northern Gallia, and in 343 CE he defeated Maxentius II outside Lutetia, having the dead body of the Emperor sacrficed posthumously to his Sword, and proclaiming himself to be ""The Slayer of Emperors"". In 351 CE, following several succesfull campaigns, Rome finally fell to the Slayer of Emperors and a subservient senate hastened to proclaim him Emperor. His dominion over Rome did not last long for in 352 CE, on the 25th of December, the Dies Natalis Solis Invicti the Sun Emperor Alexandros VIII took the city by storm after Constantine had refused to abandon the city. Alexandros VIII had him sacrificed to Sol with his own infamous Sword of Victory, before sending his head and sword to his son Constantine II of Britannia, with a message to take good care of the sword for if he would not surrender it would be used in his sacrifice as well. In 365 CE, following a long war Constantine II was ultimately assassinated by conspirators led by Marcus Artorius, his head sent to Valentinian I as an offer of submission. Valentinian I would prove merciful allowing the young Constantine III of Britannia to retain Dumnonia as a client of the Empire. The Blood of Constantine have ruled over Dumnonia ever since, and have even provided the Brythons with several of their great High Kings, yet they have never forgotten the treachery of their Artorii relatives. Holding on to their Roman legacy, the Kings of Dumnonia believe that if the Empire is to be reforged, its rebuilding should start in Britannia and not elsewhere. The Blood of the Slayer of Emperors still carry his ancient Sword of Victory to Battle and hope that one day they will dedicate it with the Blood of their great enemies the Artorii and the Julio-Argeads and thus avenge their glorious ancestors. It is said that their ancient Sword will guide them to victory, to Rome and Constantinople, where one day the Blood of the Slayer of Emperors shall rule in triumph!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hist_ivar_desc;This character is a descendant of Ivar the Boneless, son of Ragnar Lodbrok. Ivar, the Scourge of the Islands, was one of the leaders of the Norse attacks in Britannia in the middle of the 9th century CE. Ivar campaigned throughout the Islands humbling many kings from the petty Kings of Hibernia to great Kings such as Aella the High King of Northanhymbra. His legendary cruelty saw many captured Kings blood-eagled - their ribs cut off by the spine, then broken on their back, so as to resemble blood-stained wings, their lungs pulled out through the wounds in their back - in order to subdue the rest. The pale skinned Ivar became a figure of great dread and his strange sickness made many whisper of his unnatural condition. It is said that his very bones melted in the end, yet his body would not decay. While some believe that his uncorrupt body was burned in a great pyre, others believe that Ivar was sent to the bottom of the Sea and will one day rise up again to terrorize all of the Islands! His Blood remains strong, and many kings, from Bernicia, to the Isles to Dubhlin, hail Ivar as their legendary sire. They all know that their Blood carries great power, and they all hear the whispers of their great ancestor! None of the Ivarrings believe him to be gone forever, and all await his return from the Sea! Woe to the Lands of Man, when Ivar the Boneless will come again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hist_fergus_desc;This character is a descendant of Fergus Mor, the legendary Progenitor of the Gabrains of Dal Riata. The Eastern line of the Gabrains centered their power around their great stronghold of Dun Chailleann, later called Dunkeld. While their Western relatives claim to be the senior line of the family, the Eastern Gabrains care little for this claim. Their power is greater, and the number of swords they command can do the talking for them! These Gabrains of Dun Chailleann as they have come to be called have held the High Kingship of Alba more times than the Western line in recent times and can safely claim to be the strongest descendants of the Blood of Fergus! While their power has diminished of late, the true Kings of Alba have the resources to humble all of the North, including their wayward Western cousins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hist_guthrum_desc;This character is a descendant of Guthrum, the great Danish King of the Danelaw. Guthrum's dream of a great kingdom of Daneland began by humbling the lesser Danish Lords of the East. By 874 CE he had consolidated his power over much of the Danelaw and declared himself as High King of the Danes in England. His campaigns of conquest took him further and further afield, till finally he met the host of Wessex. In 878 CE at Ethandun, Alfred of Wessex defeated in Guthrum in a contest that would become the inspiration of many a song. While Alfred defeated Guthrum, his power was by no means broken, and a treaty was signed between the Danes and the Saxons, with the Great King of the Danelaw holding on to his Eastern dominions. Guthrum's later conversion to Christianity was a calculated move aimed at securing his possessions, a move which proved highly succesful, as the Christian Saxon kings surrounding his lands could stomach a Christian Danish kingdom easier than a pagan one. His Blood still rule over the great Kingdom of Daneland, although they have yet to imitate their great ancestor. While their glory might only be heard in song, they are ever ready to grasp it once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hist_halfdan_desc;This character is a descendant of Halfdan Ragnarsson, the great Norse King of Yorvik. The lesser known son of Ragnar Lodbrok, Halfdan was one of the commanders of the Great Norse Army that ravaged the British Isles in the 9th century CE. While his brothers hogged the glory, Halfdan saw to his conquests. He humbled many Saxon Kings, including Alfred in a great battle near Reading. His rule had many ups and downs and saw him in control of many great cities, including Londinium, before losing them to his many enemies. Widely feared for his cruelty, and reportedly putting even his brother Ivar to shame on that account, Halfdan lost his many domains, and would only manage to hold on to Jorvik. His blood have held on to this great Norse Kingdom ever since and to this day remain the terror of the Isles. Their Raven Banners set fear in the hearts of their enemies, for all who oppose them know that when the Ravens come calling, the Blood Eagles spread throughout the Land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hist_sweyn_desc;This character is a descendant of Sweyn Forkbeard, High King of the Danes and High King of Anglia. In 986 CE Sweyn managed to secure the High Kingship of the Danes and went on to increase his dominions wherever he could, from Norway to the Isles of the West! In 1003 CE Sweyn led the largest Norse invasion force Britannia had ever seen in an attempt to overwhelm all resistance. King after King swore fealty to the new Danish High King, and in 1005 CE he was acknowledged as the uncontested High King of the Saxons and the Norse of Britannia. In 1007 CE, his Western advances were checked at the battle of Glevum, Brennius Pendragon, High King of the Brythons soundly defeating his great Norse army. The following peace confirmed Sweyn as Overlord of the Saxons and of the Norse, while abandoning all claims on the Brython lands. Sweyn died in 1015 CE, and his realm was plunged into a great civil war with several Kings vying for the High Kingship. His son Knut would eventually emerge victorious. Knut the Great would prove an even better ruler than his father. Having served in the Varangian Guard in Constantinople in his youth, Knut returned home with great ambitions of Empire. In immitation of the Romans, he adopted Sowilo, the Sun God as a patron of his great state. Knut wold go on to establish his dominion not only over the Norse and Saxons of Briannia but over Denmark, Sweden and Norway as well. The Great Sun Emperor of the North, managed to build his great state of Miklaríki holding dominion from the Baltic to Iceland! His great Realm proved to be ephemereal, for upon Knut's death his Empire collapsed into chaos and anarchy. His descendants might rule many realms, yet all remain but shadows of their great ancestors. Will the Blood of Sweyn rebuild its Great Empire of the North, or will Miklaríki remain but a half-remembered dream? Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_rognvald;Blood of Rognvald;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_rognvald_desc;This character is a descendant of Rognvald Eysteinsson, the first Jarl of Orkney. Rognvald the Wise, a favored companion of the great Norse King Harald Fairhair went on many viking expeditions, from the Volga to the Mediterranean! After having achieved great riches during his many travels, Rognvald returned to the North, desiring to establish a Realm of his own. He set his sights on Orkney and with the help of his viking companions the islands were soon his. The Jarls of Orkney hold themselves to be Kings in their own lands, and have for many years coveted the title of Kings of the North. Their attempts at subduing the Picts and Scots have innevitably failed, yet the Great Jarls of Orkney remain the unquestioned power of the Eastern Isles. While many of the Jarls of Orkney seem more concerned with plunder than expansion, their blood still yearns for dominion over the Northern Lands, and the true Blood of Rognvald know that only riches earned from great plunder can bring them the power they need to subdue their errant neighbors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_zenobia;Blood of Zenobia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_zenobia_desc;This character is a descendant of Zenobia, Warrior Queen of Palmyra. After her husband Odaenathus was assassinated in 267 CE, Zenobia took control as Queen of Palmyra as regent for her infant son Vaballathus, and expanded the Palmyran Empire by Egypt to the south in 269 CE and Ancyra in Asia Minor to the north in 272 CE, but these gains were lost to Roman emperor Alexandros V by 275 CE. By the peace treaty, she retained the title Empress of Palmyra, but renounced control of all territory outside Palmyra proper.\n\nWhile leading her troops, she displayed significant prowess. She was an able horse rider, and would march 3 or 4 miles with her soldiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_warcislaw;Blood of Warcislaw;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_warcislaw_desc;This character is a descendant of Lech, the oldest of three Slavic warlords from the 5th century CE. Leading a loose tribal confederation, Lech and his brothers Cech and Rus conquered the lands between the Dnieper and Elbe, forcing out or assimilating their former Gothic population. Soon after Lech had established his seat of power in Gniezno, the confederaton splintered, giving birth to three great Slavic peoples - the Polish, the Czechs and the Russians. Lech and his son Lech II led huge expeditions into German lands in 496, 512 and 518 CE, reaching as far as the Atlantic Ocean according to legend. In 578 CE Warcislaw of Pommerania conducted a devastating raid into Scandinavia, plundering Bornholm, southern Skane and Saeland in his wake. Even though the divided Slavs are now just a shade of their former strength, many warlords are likely to follow a strong, charismatic leader, should one appear. And who would be a better leader than a scion of Lech himself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_krak;Blood of Krak;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_krak_desc;"Prince Krak, the founder of Kraków, was the leader of the Vistulans in the 7th century CE. According to a popular legend, he and his two sons defeated a mighty dragon living beneath hill Wawel, thus earning the nickname ""Dragonslayers"". Under Krak's dynasty's reign, Kraków became a wealthy trade hub, arguably the richest Slavic town north of the Carpathians. In 986 CE prince Krak IV defeated the Piast incursion, killing prince Mieszko in personal combat. In 987 CE the combined Lesser Polish-Silesian forces managed to rout an invasion by Czech prince Boleslav II, securing their independence for the time being. But can the ""City of the Dragonslayer"" preserve its independence against the surrounding foes?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_piast;Blood of Piast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_piast_desc;This character is a descendant of Piast the Wheelwright, a peasant who led a popular uprising against the tyrant prince Popiel of Goplans in 828 CE. Made prince by popular acclamation, Piast personally commanded the assault on Popiel's island fortress on lake Goplo and slew the tyrant in personal combat. Then he took the old Lechitic stronghold of Gniezno as his captal. Under Piast's rule, the Polans began an ambitious attempt to restore the legendary realm of Lech. This dream came to an end in 986 CE, when prince Mieszko was killed in the battle of Kraków by Krakovian ruler Krak IV. The tribes already subjugated by the Polans - the Kuyavians and Silesians - have rebelled, restoring their independence. But can Piast's dream be so easily forgotten?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_cech;Blood of Cech;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_cech_desc;Praotec Cech (ancestor Cech) was one of three Slavic warlord brothers who led the conquest of the Gothic lands between the Dnieper and Elbe in the second half of the 5th century CE. After the confederation's breakup, Cech and his tribes crossed the Sudetes, eventually founding the city of Praha on the banks of Vltava river. From his new seat of power, Cech conducted expeditions against the Hungarians, Avars and Germans, until his death in 522 CE. His son Nezamysl led an ambitious intrusion into Roman lands in 552 CE, reaching the banks of the Mediterranean. Later on, his scions became engulfed in internal conflicts, ultimately being subjugated by the Moravians in the 9th century, but the breakup of Great Moravia in the 10th century gave Premysl the Pluoghman, a distant descendant of Cech, a chance to overthrow local Moravian administration and establish a new realm on his own. Even though the renewed Czech expansion had been halted in 987 CE, the blood of Cech remains the most vibrant and fiercesome force of the southern Slavs... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_rus;Blood of Rus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_rus_desc;This character is a descendant of Rus, the youngest of three brothers who lead the conquest of Gothic lands in the 5th century CE. After the breakup of the Slavic tribal confederation, Rus returned east, taking up lands between the Bug and Dnieper rivers. After his death in 541 CE his oldest son, Vladislav, crossed the Dnieper and attempted to conquer all the lands up to Volga, while the younger Rus lead his tribes against Bosphorian Cimmeria and Crimean Goths, although he was repelled in the great battle at the banks of Tanais. Rus' descendants established numerous smaller states, fighting the surrounding Baltic, Ugro-Finnic and Altaic tribes, as well as between one another. After his arrival in 864 CE, Rurik and the Varangians managed to use the internal strives and political splintering to their advantage, ousting Rus' descendants and replacing them with Varangian nobility. Unwilling to accept Nordic overlordship, a group of nobles led by Sviatoslav III retreated west, entrenching themselves along the Danastris river. The blood of Rus needs both time and luck to regain what has been lost... Or else it will disappear, assimilated by Russia's new masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_attila;Blood of Attila;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_attila_desc;This character is a descendant of Attila the Hun, whose empire stretched from the steppes in the East to Germania in the West. Following the death of his brother and co-ruler Bleda, Attila took sole rulership of the Hunnic Empire. In 450 CE, Valentinian IVs daughter begged Attila to rescue her from an arranged marriage to the Roman-Goth Areobindus. Declaring his dowry to be the Western Empire, Attila invaded Europe a year later resulting in the death of Valentinian IV himself. With the Western Empire stunned, Attila went on to sack many vital Roman towns until Flavius Aetius managed to form a grand coalition to confront Attila at Chalons. Following the shocking defeat of Attila and his retreat to back to Pannonia, he began his plans to invade Italia. However, his plans did not come to fruition, as he died during the consummation of his marriage to the Gothic princess Ildica. Because of this, and the surprise defeat at Chalons, the Germanic vassals of Attila revolted and claimed their own portions of the crumbling empire. Amid the chaos, Attilas sons Ellac, Dengizich and Ernakh fought for the remains of their fathers empire. Now, the descendents of Attila rule but a fraction of his vast empire, yet the arrival of similar nomadic steppe warriors causes their blood to stir. But will they rise and take back what is rightfully theirs by conquest?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_diocletian;Blood of Diocletian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_diocletian_desc;This character is a descendant of Gaius Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus, who reigned as co-emperor beside Alexandros VI. Diocletian fought alongside Alexandros in the East and also led his own invasion of Gallia. Following Alexandros capture and blinding by the treacherous Antonius Ptolemy, Diocletian rushed to the aid of his co-emperor and defeated the Egyptians at the legendary Siege of Alexandria. Diocletian and Alexandros continued to campaign in the East until the latters disappearance and assumed death. Exactly a year later, Diocletian died in his palace in Split. Now his scions are but a fraction of their former glory, surrounded by the newly arrived barbaric Slavs. Will they dredge themselves up out of the mire they currently find themselves in?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_valentinian;Blood of Valentinian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_valentinian_desc;This character is a descendant of Flavius Valentinianus, who reigned as co-emperor alongside Julian II and Alexandros VIII. Early in his career, Valentinian was delivered a surprise victory over Constantine II of Britannia due to what can only be described as divine intervention. He promptly converted to Christianity. Emboldened by his victories in Britannia, Valentinian decided to split the empire in two: he and his brother Valens ruled in the West, whilst Julian and Alexandros ruled in the East. The rising persecution of Christians in the Eastern Empire enraged Valentinian and forced him to forge an alliance with Shapur II of the Persian Empire, who then proceeded to invade the Eastern Empire from the East. After a failed siege at Constantinople Valentinian met Julian in battle again, this time outside Athens. It was here that Valentinian fell in combat against his former friend. His descendants continued to hold on to the throne of the Western Empire despite many interruptions, yet now their authority extends no further than the city of Rome itself. Will the family of Valentinianus restore the Western Empire to its former extent? Or will their star rise ever higher and even unite the fractured Empire?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_aurelius;Blood of Aurelius;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_aurelius_desc;This character is a descendant of Marcus Aurelius, who reigned as co-emperor alongside Antoninus Pius and then Lucius Verus. It was during his reign that the first widespread persecutions against Christians began. It was also during Marcus Aurelius reign when the border provinces of the Empire were re-purposed into military frontiers in order to protect against the recent barbarian incursions. Following Aurelius death, his son Commodus succeeded him as emperor and patronised the cults of Sol Invictus and Mithras. Now the descendants of Aurelius reign in Venice, in the precarious position of being caught between Germanic barbarians and ambitious fellow Romans. Will they find the strength to seize the throne of the Roman Empire once more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_augustus;Blood of Augustus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_augustus_desc;This character is a descendant of Octavian Augustus, the first emperor of Rome. Following the assassination of Caesar, Octavian fought against Marcus Antonius in the second major Roman Civil War. They soon reconciled however and fought to restore order in the Republics eastern provinces. In 41 BCE, Marcus Antonius was seduced by Cleopatra VII and hatched his plan to become Megas Basileus of the East. Because of this treachery, Octavian gathered his Seleukid and Nabatean allies and defeated Marcus Antonius forces in Egypt, driving the traitor to commit suicide. With order restored, Octavian was granted the cognomen Augustus. In 27 BCE he married Alexandra Argead, a descendant of Megas Alexandros himself. Just four years later Augustus was proclaimed as the first Princeps of the new Roman Empire. Until his death in 14 CE, Augustus fought tirelessly to keep the borders of the Empire intact against various barbarians and the rebellion of the Ptolemaios in Egypt. He was succeeded by his son Alexandros, who struggled for decades against increasing barbarian raids and the rise of Parthia in the East. Even though the scions of Augustus do not currently control the throne of the much-weakened Roman Empire, it is within their grasp. Will they do what is necessary to take back their birthright?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_popiel;Blood of Popiel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_popiel_desc;This character is a descendant of prince Popiel of the Goplans. Once a hegemon of northern Poland, Popiel's realm has been shattered in 828 CE when Piast the Wheelwright of the Polans led a popular uprising aganst his tyranic rule. After Popiel got slain by Piast inside his islandic hold on lake Goplo, his only son Gniewomir fled east, ultimately finding refuge on the east bank of Vistula. The restored Popielid principality, led by Popiel's grandson Lech, campaigned against Piast prince Lestek in 889 CE, reestablishing control over the lands of Kuyavia. Thus the rising star of the Piasts has been counterbalanced for the time being - but Lech's untimely death in 891 CE almost resulted in the Popielid realm being divided between his twin brothers Popiel II and Skarbimir. Will the Popielids manage to restore their position among the Lechitic tribes - or shall they vanish from history forever?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_theodosius;Blood of Theodosius;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_theodosius_desc;This character is a descendant of Flavius Theodosius, who reigned as co-emperor alongside Valentinian II. It was during his reign that Christianity was instituted as the state religion of the Western Empire. In 382 CE, Theodosius ordered the destruction of the Temple of the Vestal Virgins and the defilement of the Sacred Heart of Sol, enraging Julian II in the process. Julian then invaded the West and conquered the city of Rome within three months. Valentinian and Theodosius regrouped at Ravenna where they were beaten again by Julian. Following this, they fled first to Gallia and then Hispania, where Theodosius instigated the foederati and other barbarian tribes to invade the Empire. In 387 CE, Julian was mortally wounded and so embarked upon his final journey into the desert. By this time Valentinian and Theodosius had gathered the support of the Severans of the Hispania, which they then used to re-establish their authority in the Western Empire. Because of tensions between the Eastern Empire and the Persians, Theodosius made peace with Alexandros IX who is now the sole emperor of the East. Theodosius died in 395 CE of sun stroke, to which Alexandros replied is only fitting. He was then succeeded by his son Honorius as co-emperor. However the true ruler of the Western Empire becomes the half-Vandal general Stilicho. Honorius later moved his capital to Ravenna, where his descendants still reign today. With the power of the Western Emperor broken, will the Blood of Theodosius once again reclaim their Empire?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_aetius;Blood of Aetius;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_aetius_desc;This character is a descendant of Flavius Aetius, the Roman general who defeated Attila the Hun. Aetius was used as a hostage to placate the enemies of Rome twice, the first time he was sent to the Visigoths in 405 CE, and then he was sent to the Huns in 409 CE. His first military action was to restore Roman rule in Gallia and in doing so he subjugated the Visigoth kingdom of Aquitaine, the Burgundians and the Salian Franks. Following Aetius first victory against the Huns, Valentinian IV appointed Aetius as co-emperor of the West. In 451 CE, Aetius managed the impossible and gathered a large coalition against the renewed vigour of the Huns under their new leader Attila, and defeated them at the Battle of Chalons. However the new emperor, Valentinian V, saw Aetius as a threat and ordered his assassination, followed by the appointment of Aetius son as hereditary governor of Panormus to divert any suspicion away from himself. The descendants of Flavius Aetius still rule in Panormus and their anger at their betrayal has only grown stronger over the centuries. Will they take their rightful revenge against the manipulative Romans?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_david;Blood of David;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_david_desc;David, son of Jesse, of the Tribe of Judah, slayer of Goliath and champion of the Israelites, ruled over and expanded the kingdom of Israel and moved its capital to Jerusalem. After the division of the kingdom during his grandson Rehoboam's reign, the southern kingdom of Judah continued to be ruled by the House of David until its conquest by the Babylonians. Despite this, the descendants of David survived, though not in power until after 135 CE. In that year, following the defeat of the bar Kokhba revolt in Judea and the expulsion of the Jews from that province, many were resettled in Sinai, where resettlement of Jews had started following the Jewish revolt of the preceding century, and a scion of the House of David was installed as Rome's client to keep them in order.\n\nIt has been prophesied that one of David's descendants shall be the messiah. Can they reforge the Kingdom of David and Solomon and bring back the golden age of Israel?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_mithridates;Blood of Mithridates;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_mithridates_desc;This character is a descendant of Mithridates VI of Pontus, crowned Megas Basileus in Pella after receiving the submission of Asia Minor and Hellas. Mithridates began the expansion of his kingdom by seizing Bythinia to the west, following which the Hellens of Asia Minor submitted to this growing power. Soon after, Mithridates would take advantage of the civil war in Rome between Sulla and Marius, invading the client state of Makedonia. Once in Pella, Mithridates proclaimed himself Megas Basileus and continued his campaign south, defeating the Spartan and Athenian army at Pydna, where the Spartans, refusing to surrender, were killed to a man. He would continue to win victories against both Hellenic and Roman forces until he would finally be defeated by Gnaeus Pompeius and King Deiotarus of Galatia. \nForced to flee to his son's kingdom of Cimmerian Bosphorus, he was pursued by Pompeius who soundly defeated the Pontic army. Mithidates son, Machares, betrayed and murdered his father hoping to cater favor with Rome. However Pompeius executed Machares for fratricide and installed Mithidates VII as a Roman client in Pontus, whose descendants still rule over Pontus. But with the current state of affairs in the Empire, will they be able to once again claim the title Megas Basileus?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_hieron;Blood of Hieron;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_hieron_desc;This character is a descendant of Hieron II, King of Syracuse and ally to Rome against the Carthaginians. Hieron was preceded by Agothocles who had united the island, but his death created a succession crisis. Taking advantage of the situation, mercenaries called the Mamertines gained control of the north east of the island with their base at Massinia. Hieron emerged from the succession crisis and defeated the Mamertines at Mylae, gaining control of the whole of Sicily. \nThe true test of his reign would come at the speartips of the Sacred Band of Carthage. Hieron requested aid from Rome, thus sparking the first Punic war. Driving the Carthaginians from Sicily the two nations signed a treaty of eternal alliance. The Hieronids would continue to provide Rome with ships and men in their many wars, but the occupation of the Vandals and Muslims have left the island Kingdom weak. Will the scions of Hieron once again spread their rule across their island home and beyond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_maccabeus;Blood of Maccabeus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_maccabeus_desc;This figure is a Hasmonean, a descendent of Judah Maccabeus, the Sledgehammer of Judea. In 167 BCE his father Mattathias began a rebellion against the cruel policies of the Seleukids, but died within a year, leaving Judah to pick up his father's torch. Judah did not falter, and lead the Chosen people to victory after victory over the Seleukids, joining the ranks of Joshua, Gideon, and David as one of Israelfs greatest heroes! \nWhen Seleukid strength proved too much, Judah invited in the Romans, who helped force King Demetrius to recognize Judah as King of Judea in 160 BCE, although the following year Judah was treacherously killed while in prayer, likely on Demetrius's orders. The star of the Hasmoneans has since fallen, but it has not disappeared. From their citadel in Beersheb the heirs of Judah pray to Yahweh Sabaoth for victory over the infidels who now lord over Israel. Soon, the idolaters will once again know to fear the Sledgehammer of Judea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_viriathus;Blood of Viriathus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_viriathus_desc;This character is a descendent of Viriathus, King of the Lusitani and first High King over Hispania. Valiant in dangers, prudent and careful in providing whatever was necessary, Viriathus was a man cut from the same cloth as the Homeric Heroes of old! When Punicus of Lusitania bowed to the Romans, one of the conditions was that the youngest soldiers, the flower of the Lusitanian military, be put to death. The order was carried out in 150 BCE, but one young soldier survived and the following year, he was king, and Punicusfs head decorated his spear. Viriathus moved fast, and in five years he unified the Lusitani, Celtiberi, and Iberian tribes into a single, unified force that fought Rome to a standstill at Numantia. \nFor centuries afterwards his line ruled Lusitania even as their hold over the rest of Hispania was broken by the Germanic tribes. The message of Mithras-Christ brought new fervor to their line, and it was a Viriathan, Martim Viriathus Vimaranes, who defeated the Caliph of Cordoba and prevented a Muslim conquest of Hispania. Now, with the blessing of Mithras Christ and the strength of the Lusitani, the line of Viriathus is poised to unite and free Hispania once again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_chlorus;Blood of Chlorus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_chlorus_desc;This figure is descended from Constantius Chlorus. A sickly man, he was nonetheless appointed co-emperor by Diocletian, and in 296 CE, forced the rebel Maximus Artorius II to make peace with the Empire. Chlorus continued to campaign in Gaul and Britain, finally dying in 306 at the hands of the Picts. Never a zealot, his participation in the purges against Christianity consisted of knocking down two (abandoned) churches and being curt to a priest once. Chlorus was nonetheless blessed, for he produced three lines of rulers! But of these lines, the Konstantinians, descended from his grandson Cosntantius II, consider themselves the most pure of Chlorus' heirs. They do not profane themselves with barbaric ceremonies around a sword like the Constantinids of Dumnonia (descended from his grandson Constantine of Britannia), nor do they profess to personify a fictitious sun god like the Julianoi (descended from his third son Julius Constantius). No, they maintain the traditional Cult of the Emperor, and they know that someday, an Emperor with the proper bloodline, one worthy of worship, will reign once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_theodoric;Blood of Theodoric;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_theodoric_desc;This person is of the blood of Theodoric the Great, son of Theodemir and the only man to ever rule over all Goths, Ostro- and Visi- alike. In 478 CE Theodoric forced the Celtic kings of Tylis and Singidunum to accept his authority over that of Constantinoplefs. Leaving his brother Theodemir II to rule the Balkans in his name, Theodoric traveled west, attacking the Western Empire on the suggestion of Emperor Zeno. Though he failed, he simply went further west, uniting the disparate Goths of Southern Gallia. He was then invited by the Visigoths to be regent, for the Balthing king Amalric was too young to rule. \nWhen the Tervingi king protested this, Theodoric simply invited him to a banquet and had a toast with him, then strangled the Visigoth with his own two hands! And while not even Theodoric could stand against Clovis of the Franks, he was also one of the few men who could speak his mind around the infamously ruthless Merovingian. Theodoric was finally betrayed by his daughter Amalasuntha and killed in 515 CE. Though his empire did not outlast him, the Kings of Aquitaine still look to Theodoric as the great champion of Gothic Arianism. Even the Tieudiskaz respect and honor him, knowing him as Dietrich of Bern. And from Alcantara all the way to Crimea, Goths everywhere know that one man almost forged them into an empire capable of rivaling Rome. If not for an ungrateful brat of a daughter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_arminius;Blood of Widukind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_arminius_desc;This Character is of the blood of Widukind. Little is known of who he was before rising to prominence, and even his true name is unknown, Widukind is merely a kenning which means Child of the Woods. He was the leader of the continental Saxons in 777 CE, when Charlemagne, King of the Franks invaded the lands of the Saxons with intention to incorporate them to his new Holy Roman Empire. Just before a great battle with Charlemagnes forces, Widukind was invited by the priest-keepers of the Great Irminsul of Paderborn to meet it in order to receive blessings from Wotan himself; the only non-priest ever allowed to enter their sacred grove. Whatever transpired there, Widukind came out of the experience a changed man. On the next day, the Saxons won a crushing victory against the Frankish forces of Charlemagne. Widukind was reportedly seen fighting in the frontlines like he was 'possessed by the spirit of an animal.'. This defeat made the Frankish King retreat completely from Saxon lands and convinced him not to try to invade their territory ever again during his reign. Widukind was last seen in 785 CE, entering yet again into the sacred grove of Paderborn. Legends are told that that he became one with the Great Irminsul that day. His descendants still rule the tribe of the Saxons, knowing that their leader of legend still watches over them his eyes being all the trees in Germania. Will they finally be able to unite the bickering tribes of their homeland and carve out a great kingdom, the blood of their enemies offered to the Irminsuls? Only time will tell;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_asander;Blood of Asander;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_asander_desc;"This character is a descendant of Asander, basileus of the Bosporus kingdom in the 1st century B.C. He was installed client-king by Pompey in 64 B.C after his help against Machares, the son of Mithridates VI and would pursue during his whole reign a semi-autonomous policy. He expanded his dominions along the Pont-Euxin and would come to conflict with Burebista, the Dacian king. After a draw at the battle of Histria, a treaty of Friendship was proclaimed between the two kingdoms and Asander married Boriava, a daughter of Burebista. He had Pharnaces II, basileus of Pontus, killed after he fled to his court as a sign of his ""friendship"" for Caesar. He was the first king who patronized the cult of Apollo-Boreas as the state cult. \nDespite numerous invasions, from the Goths, the Huns and other steppes tribes, and also the loss of Panticapaeum to the Audianist merchants, his descendants still rule the Northern Shore of Pont-Euxin. The Hellens of the Cimmerian Bosporus now await the return of a great king to reclaim their old territories and to blow upon their enemies the cold breath of Apollo-Boreas.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_aniketos;Blood of Aniketos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_aniketos_desc;"This character is a descendant of the mighty line of Demetrius I Aniketos. In 184 BCE, Demetrius made the most of his position as the ruler of the furthest east of Alexander's old empire in Central Asia. After successfully invading large swathes of India, he used an amalgamation of Indohellenic aristocrats, Zhao bureaucrats, and Galatian soldiers to rule. However, his life was cut short by the traitorous Apollodotus I Soter before he could solidify his conquests. His sons split his empire, with Demetrius II taking India and Antimachus I taking Marakanda. When Demetrius II was assassinated by his general, Pusyamitra Sunga, his realm collapsed. Sunga would kill the usurper Apollodotus, but a coalition led by Antimachus and his younger brother, Menander, would eventually retake India. Menander cut ties with Marakanda after Antimachus was assassinated, and though he placed Antimachus's son on the throne of Marakanda thereafter, relations between the two sides of the family were never the same. The older line of the Aniketos once again found themselves limited to Marakanda. However, years later, the ambitious Alexandros II Aniketos saw an opportunity in the Peasant Rebellions against the Han, and set aside his rivalry with Menander's descendant, Epander II, to invade China from two directions. Alexandros made the legendary Katabasis to the Pacific in 96 BCE. He is said to have tearfully lamented that there were no worlds left to conquer, and instead sought to solidify his position in his new empire of Archeserika. Though the family has survived the centuries, the years have not been kind to the Aniketos family. Now, they are divided into a few small fiefdoms, but perhaps they could one day repeat the feats of their ancestors, or surpass them.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_epanderos;Blood of Epander;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_epanderos_desc;"This character hails from the line of Epander II and his grandfather, Menander I. The family's origins are murky, but they are believed to share a common ancestor with the Aniketos dynasty, and split from their cousins in 158 BCE when Menander, the new Megas Basileus of India, lost his ally and brother Antimachus in Marakanda. After that, Menander married a daughter of Apollodotus I, and his descendants would view themselves as separate from the Aniketos line in Marakanda. In 155 BCE, Menander invaded Lanka. After a successful conquest, Menander campaigned into China during the Rebellion of the Seven States, hammering the Han Dynasty and forcing them into a treaty of Eternal Frendship. His brother Alexandros was placed on the throne of the new satrapy of Antiocheia Eschate, based in Chengdu. Later, in 134 BCE, Epander I marched east, carving new provinces out of Burma and Nam Viet. His descendants would engage in a joint invasion of China with their distant Aniketos cousins. Meanwhile, the Megas Basileus's of India would campaign further south, conquering the Malay Peninsula and calling it Epandreia. This represenetd the apex of their power, and Epander III's navy perished in the Straits of Malacca before he could land in Sumatra. Since then, the family has been involved in some of the most brutal wars in Indian history, fighting both native kingdoms and Indohellenic rivals, and they are now a shadow of their former selves. Despite this, the Epanderos line still proudly claims the title of Megas Basileus of India, while other branches rule in far flung lands. Though hard times have befallen the descendants of Epander, they still remember their former power, and yearn to win back what they have lost.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aelle;Blood of Aelle;;;;;;;;;;;x
aelle_desc;This character is a descendant of Aelle, first King of the South Saxons. In 478 CE, Aelle established his dominion over Suthseaxna, and then went on to be acknowledged as High King by most of the Saxons of Britannia. Aelle alternated between a policy of war and diplomacy towards the Brythons, which would ultimately prove disastrous. In 515 CE Aelle was captured by a contingent of Artorian Sarmatian cavalry and used for target practice. His body, pierced by countless arrows was left to rot for days before it was found by his Saxon followers. His descendants the Aellings remian one of the most prestigious royal families of the Saxons to this day. His bloodline held on to Sussex and also provided the British Saxons with several High Kings. While their power is much diminished, a worthy heir of Aelle could still rise once more to the High Kingship, and maybe one day even avenge his ancestor by repaying the Sarmato-Brythons for the ancient murder of their sire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

aescwine_desc;This character is a descendant of Aescwine, first King of the East Saxons.In 527 CE, Aescwine established his dominion over what would become Essex, one of the traditional kingdoms of the Saxons. Aescwine held dominion over his people, partly on behalf of his illustrious lineage, for he claimed direct descent from Seaxneat, the ancient Forefather-King-God of the Saxons. Claiming senior right of blood over the rest of the Kings of the Saxons his descendants often vied for the title of Bretwalda, and often met with success in their endeavors. Known for their diplomatic prowess, the heirs of Aescwine proved worthy of their forefather, yet in spite of all their skill and power their dominion dwindled, for a wave of new Conquerors evicted them from much of their lands. The Norse now reign in their ancient capital of Londinium, and this is something the blood of Aescwine can not tolerate! A King of their Blood must set this wrong aright, and have the ancient Holy Blood of the Saxons returned to their rightful capital and place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aetius;Blood of Aetius;;;;;;;;;;;x
aetius_desc;This character is a descendant of Flavius Aetius, the Roman general who defeated Attila the Hun. Aetius was used as a hostage to placate the enemies of Rome twice, the first time he was sent to the Visigoths in 405 CE, and then he was sent to the Huns in 409 CE. His first military action was to restore Roman rule in Gallia and in doing so he subjugated the Visigoth kingdom of Aquitaine, the Burgundians and the Salian Franks. Following Aetius first victory against the Huns, Valentinian IV appointed Aetius as co-emperor of the West. In 451 CE, Aetius managed the impossible and gathered a large coalition against the renewed vigour of the Huns under their new leader Attila, and defeated them at the Battle of Chalons. However the new emperor, Valentinian V, saw Aetius as a threat and ordered his assassination, followed by the appointment of Aetius son as hereditary governor of Panormus to divert any suspicion away from himself. The descendants of Flavius Aetius still rule in Panormus and their anger at their betrayal has only grown stronger over the centuries. Will they take their rightful revenge against the manipulative Romans?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

agiad_desc;The bloodline of Agis I, son of Eurysthenes, blood of Heracles, King of Sparta has provided Lakedaimon with its senior line of kings for milennia. This is Sparta and Sparta does things differently... The city has two kings, called Arkhagetai, with the two dynastic lines descending from the twins Eurysthenes and Procles. These Heraclidae Kings of Sparta are split into the senior Agiad and junior Eurypontid line. Fueled by the Spartan warrior ethos the Kings of Sparta are legendary figures, from the immortal Leonidas and his 300, to Agesilaus II, Basileus of the Hellenes. Molon labe! the Spartans still shout before being asked to surrender as they inevitably meet some superior force on the battlefield...and then proceed to humble it. While its great traditions never died out. Sparta did lose its glory as the star of Makedon rose, but the Lakedaemonians still managed to hold on to their corner of the Peloponesus. The Romans, great admirers of the Spartan militaristic state allowed them to continue as a vassal kingdom, and the Spartans, ever more insular dedicated themselves to martial perfection. The Spartan Homoioi -those who are the same- fought for the Romans in countless battles, many of them in the shade of clouds of arrows fired by Eastern hosts. The Agiads still rule over the city to this day, and upon their ascension to kingship they go on a sacred pilgrimage to Thermopylae, where they recite the famous epigram of Simonides, so that they might remember what it is to be Spartan: O ksein', angellein Lakedaimoniois hoti teide keimetha, tois keinon rhemasi peithomenoi - Go tell the Spartans, stranger passing by, that here obedient to their laws we lie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alexander;Blood of Alexandros;;;;;;;;;;;x
alexander_desc;This character is a proud descendant of Megas Alexandros. His son by Roxana, Alexandros IV was a tragic figure, blinded in a childhood accident. Following unrest he retired to Cyprus, where he took little interest in the affairs of the world. The main line of the Argeadai became irrelevant, yet respected rulers of their island kingdom, while the secondary line, descended from Stateira became glorified marriage partners for the daughters of the Diadokhoi. It is said the Conqueror's blood boils with ambition and echoes of Alexandros's thoughts still reverberate through the very spirit of his heirs! The blood keeps whispering to them that they should only weep when there is nothing left to conquer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Almaqah holds a cluster of lightning bolts in his hand, surrounding a sacred sickle-sword, ready to smite those who would bring Darkness to his Sacred Realm. From their great capital of Ma'rib the Priest Kings of Saba rule over a powerful, unconquerable Realm beloved to the Sun above. Masters of the spice trade their caravans ply the sands of Arabia and beyond, bringing great wealth to the Children of the Sun. Their impregnable Dominion is centered upon great fortified cities where Sun Priests invoke the benevolent grace of Almaqah and merchant princes plan their next trade expeditions. The armies of Almaqah are centered upon the steadfast heavy infantry of Sabaean cities, complemented by the impetous light cavalry of the nobility and desert tribesmen who call the Mukarrib, their Lord. The Sun Lords of Ma'rib have proved their divine heritage as their Glorious Kingdom stands impregnable on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula defying all those who would possess its wealth. From their magnificent Holy City of Ma'rib, the Blood of Almaqah plan great conquests as they wish to go forth in glory over the Ocean of Sand to the North and bring back the worship of the Sun to their errant Northern cousins.

amyntas_desc;"Amyntas, Tetrarch of the Trocmi, and King of Galatia was the greatest of all Galatian Kings. After his conquest of Kappadokia, Amyntas defeated Antiochus XIV in battle near Mazaka, had the Seleukid Basileus torn to pieces and went on to besiege Antiocheia. In 34 BCE, Amyntas received the submission of Armenia, and in 32 BCE became Sovereign of Atropatene. His legendary campaign against Parthia was crowned by his defeat of Phraates IV near Hecatompylos. His Tindotae are said to have refused to emasculate the Parthian dead after considering them ""not manly enough to be worth the trouble."" Amyntas entered Hecatompylos in triumph and had himself acclaimed King of Kings. 7 days later he was dead, in mysterious circumstances, and with him died the dream of a Galatian Empire to rival Alexandros's. His descendants continued to rule in Galatia and proved to be major players in Imperial politics as their warlike state became a source of great military strength for those who could command its loyalty. The proud warlike Galatians were also widely used as military colonists throughout the known world, and their heritage can be found from the Pillars of Hercules to Helleno-China. The adoption of the cult of Eosphorus, the Dawn Bringer as the state religion of the Kingdom further strenghtened this unbreakable people. Eosphorus, Lucifer, the True Lord of Hosts commands his subjects to carry on his eternal battle against the False Gods of Darkness, who would enslave Man, subject him to countless indignities and condemn him to eternal servitude, gods such as Yahweh or his son the so-called Christ. The Galatian Kings remember their proud heritage and know their Divine Mission. One day the Dawn Bringer shall topple the False Gods of the Yahwists and Light shall reign in eternal Glory over the Realms of Man!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
arminius;Blood of Widukind;;;;;;;;;;;x
arminius_desc;This Character is of the blood of Widukind. Little is known of who he was before rising to prominence, and even his true name is unknown, Widukind is merely a kenning which means Child of the Woods. He was the leader of the continental Saxons in 777 CE, when Charlemagne, King of the Franks invaded the lands of the Saxons with intention to incorporate them to his new Holy Roman Empire. Just before a great battle with Charlemagnes forces, Widukind was invited by the priest-keepers of the Great Irminsul of Paderborn to meet it in order to receive blessings from Wotan himself; the only non-priest ever allowed to enter their sacred grove. Whatever transpired there, Widukind came out of the experience a changed man. On the next day, the Saxons won a crushing victory against the Frankish forces of Charlemagne. Widukind was reportedly seen fighting in the frontlines like he was 'possessed by the spirit of an animal.'. This defeat made the Frankish King retreat completely from Saxon lands and convinced him not to try to invade their territory ever again during his reign. Widukind was last seen in 785 CE, entering yet again into the sacred grove of Paderborn. Legends are told that that he became one with the Great Irminsul that day. His descendants still rule the tribe of the Saxons, knowing that their leader of legend still watches over them his eyes being all the trees in Germania. Will they finally be able to unite the bickering tribes of their homeland and carve out a great kingdom, the blood of their enemies offered to the Irminsuls? Only time will tell;;;;;;;;;;;;x
artgal;Blood of Artgal;;;;;;;;;;;x
artgal_desc;This character is a descendant of Artgal of Alt Clut, King of Ystrad Clud and High King of the Hen Ogledd. Known by the Brythons as the Great Artorius of the North, Artgal of Alt Clut ruled over a vast kingdom centered around his great fortress of Dun Breatainn, the oldest stronghold still standing in all of the Islands! His endless wars against the Picts ruined his kingdom, and while the Picts could not overcome him, the great fortress of Dun Breatainn fell after a great siege by the Norse. The Brythons withstood the Norse for 4 months, but in the end the wells of the castle dried out. Rather than surrender the Great King Artgal and his followers died of thirst, defiance on their lips to the very bitter end! His bloodline survived this trial and remain to this day the proudest of Kings, ruling over the Northern bastion of the Brythons, the Kingdom of Ystrad Clud. These proud Artorii of the North have proved their mettle time and time again, and none can deny that given the right circumstances they are capable of once more ruling over the great Hen Ogledd. Woe to their enemies! The Kings of Ystrad Clud know not the meaning of defeat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
artorius;Blood of Artorius;;;;;;;;;;;x
artorius_desc;"The general Lucius Artorius, commander of the Sarmatian Cavalry of Alexandros III, was the bastard son of King Abgar IX of Osroene. In 207 CE, Lucius Artorius was sent at the head of a great Daco-Sarmatian army to Britannia to defeat the Republicans under Clodius Albinus. His defeat of the Republicans in the great battle of Londinium, and the trampling of the body of Clodius Albinus, still clutching the SPQR banner remain the stuff of legend. Alexandros III would fondly call him ""The True Destroyer of the Republic"". His subsequent defeat of the Caledoni and the sacrifice of their King Circennos by his Sarmatian cavalrymen having a Sword of Victory dedicated to the War God thrust in the ground through the still beating heart of the King, would only add to the Artorian myth. Wielding his Sword of Victory Lucius Artorius went on to campaign beyond the Wall, reaching the Northern End of the World, as no civilized man had done before him. Lucius Artorius was later named hereditary Supreme Military governor of Britannia, and his power over the Island was enforced by a vast programme of Daco-Sarmatian colonization. In 259 his descendant Maximus Artorius proclaimed himself Emperor of Britannia, and would go on to become Gallic Emperor and co-Emperor of the Roman Empire. In 500 CE, another Artorian, Magnus Artorius, High King of Britannia won the great Brython victory of Mons Badonicus over the Saxon invaders, thus stopping their Western advance. In 537, he would die killed in sigle combat by his own son Mordred, during the Battle of Camlann. The Artorii would go on to produce many High Kings of the Brythons and lesser kings as well. The senior Sarmato-Brython branch of the family took up the name Pendragon - ""Head Dragon"" - as their Sarmatian Dragon Banners became the symbol of the dynasty. Another symbol of the dynasty remains Lucius Artorius's Sword of Victory, the true symbol of Artorian kingship. Each Artorian King is supposed to sacrifice at least one man to the Sword of the War God throughout his reign in order to be recognized as a True King. The greater the rank of the sacrificed man, the Greater the King, the legend goes, and many great men of Britannia saw their end with the Sword of Victory thrust into the ground through their beating heart. While the power of the Artorii is much diminished, men still tremble at the very sight of the invincible Dragon Banners! It is said that a True King wielding the Sword of Victory will once more humble the West and show himself to the world by having an Emperor sacrificed to the War God. The Sword thirsts for blood and the Dragon Banners are restless! The Horse Lords of the West are ready to ride forth in glory!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

He was installed client-king by Pompey in 64 B.C after his help against Machares, the son of Mithridates VI and would pursue during his whole reign a semi-autonomous policy. He expanded his dominions along the Pont-Euxin and would come to conflict with Burebista, the Dacian king. After a draw at the battle of Histria, a treaty of Friendship was proclaimed between the two kingdoms and Asander married Boriava, a daughter of Burebista. He had Pharnaces II, basileus of Pontus, killed after he fled to his court as a sign of his ""friendship"" for Caesar. He was the first king who patronized the cult of Apollo-Boreas as the state cult. \nDespite numerous invasions, from the Goths, the Huns and other steppes tribes, and also the loss of Panticapaeum to the Audianist merchants, his descendants still rule the Northern Shore of Pont-Euxin.

attila_desc;This character is a descendant of Attila the Hun, whose empire stretched from the steppes in the East to Germania in the West. Following the death of his brother and co-ruler Bleda, Attila took sole rulership of the Hunnic Empire. In 450 CE, Valentinian IVs daughter begged Attila to rescue her from an arranged marriage to the Roman-Goth Areobindus. Declaring his dowry to be the Western Empire, Attila invaded Europe a year later resulting in the death of Valentinian IV himself. With the Western Empire stunned, Attila went on to sack many vital Roman towns until Flavius Aetius managed to form a grand coalition to confront Attila at Chalons. Following the shocking defeat of Attila and his retreat to back to Pannonia, he began his plans to invade Italia. However, his plans did not come to fruition, as he died during the consummation of his marriage to the Gothic princess Ildica. Because of this, and the surprise defeat at Chalons, the Germanic vassals of Attila revolted and claimed their own portions of the crumbling empire. Amid the chaos, Attilas sons Ellac, Dengizich and Ernakh fought for the remains of their fathers empire. Now, the descendents of Attila rule but a fraction of his vast empire, yet the arrival of similar nomadic steppe warriors causes their blood to stir. But will they rise and take back what is rightfully theirs by conquest?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

augustus_desc;This character is a descendant of Octavian Augustus, the first emperor of Rome. Following the assassination of Caesar, Octavian fought against Marcus Antonius in the second major Roman Civil War. They soon reconciled however and fought to restore order in the Republics eastern provinces. In 41 BCE, Marcus Antonius was seduced by Cleopatra VII and hatched his plan to become Megas Basileus of the East. Because of this treachery, Octavian gathered his Seleukid and Nabatean allies and defeated Marcus Antonius forces in Egypt, driving the traitor to commit suicide. With order restored, Octavian was granted the cognomen Augustus. In 27 BCE he married Alexandra Argead, a descendant of Megas Alexandros himself. Just four years later Augustus was proclaimed as the first Princeps of the new Roman Empire. Until his death in 14 CE, Augustus fought tirelessly to keep the borders of the Empire intact against various barbarians and the rebellion of the Ptolemaios in Egypt. He was succeeded by his son Alexandros, who struggled for decades against increasing barbarian raids and the rise of Parthia in the East. Even though the scions of Augustus do not currently control the throne of the much-weakened Roman Empire, it is within their grasp. Will they do what is necessary to take back their birthright?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

aurelius_desc;This character is a descendant of Marcus Aurelius, who reigned as co-emperor alongside Antoninus Pius and then Lucius Verus. It was during his reign that the first widespread persecutions against Christians began. It was also during Marcus Aurelius reign when the border provinces of the Empire were re-purposed into military frontiers in order to protect against the recent barbarian incursions. Following Aurelius death, his son Commodus succeeded him as emperor and patronised the cults of Sol Invictus and Mithras. Now the descendants of Aurelius reign in Venice, in the precarious position of being caught between Germanic barbarians and ambitious fellow Romans.

The Bellonids became hereditary rulers of the short-lived Spanish March, and under Wilfred the Hairy, Lord of Barcelona, the former territories of the March were reorganized into a powerful Principality. The proud symbol of the Bellonids, the Senyera, the golden flag with four red stripes of the House of Barcelona dates back to Wilfred's participation in the failed Spanish Crusade of Karolus the Bold. Following a great victory against the infidels, the wounded Frankish King smeared four bloodied fingers over Wilfred's golden shield thus giving birth to the eternal symbol of the Catalans.

After several succesfull campaigns Brian received the submission of all of the Kings of the island, from the ruthless Norse Ivarrings of Dublin to the proud Conchobairs of Connacht. In a sacred ceremony on the Holy Hill of Tara, Brian drank the royal ale, and married the goddess Medb. It is said that as the ceremony came to a close Brian touched the Lia Fáil, the Stone of Destiny, and the stone sang, as it had not since time of Cúchulainn! As the rightful king of Ireland, Brian should have enjoyed a long and prosperous reign, but it was not to be. In 1014, at the Battle of Clontarf, Brian led his Fianna Fáil, his warriors of Destiny, against a vast Norse host, and while his army emerged victorious their rightful king fell to treachery. It is said that in Sacred Tara the Lia Fáil roared with sorrow, and that since then it has fallen silent once more. Maybe it will come to be, that one day another king of the blood of Brian will become Ard Ri of Hibernia, and go on to Tara so the Stone may roar again! Until then the Lia Fáil is waiting in silence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britconstantine;Blood of Constantine of Britannia;;;;;;;;;;;x
britconstantine_desc;"This character is a descendant of Constantine the Great, of Britannia, Slayer of Emperors. In 315 CE, Constantine of Britannia, the son of Emperor Constantine, founder of Constantinople, and grandson of the Julio-Argead princess Helena, was married to the Artorian princess Axara and made hereditary military governor of Dumnonia by his father in order to weaken the Artorian hold on Britannia. In 330 CE Constantine passed over his son as co-Emperor naming Maxentius II as co-Emperor in control of Gallia. Constantine of Britannia rebelled and defeated Maxentius II in a great battle outside Londinium. In 337 CE while campaigning in Britannia against his son, the Emperor Constantine was captured in a surprise night attack by his son's Sarmatian cavalrymen. Constantine of Britannia asked his father to appoint him as co-Emperor and successor and Constatine I refused, declaring he would rather die instead. His enraged son had his father executed in the Sarmatian fashion, a Sword of Victory dedicated to the War God thrust through his heart into the earth. In 340 CE, Constantine of Britannia defeated another Imperial invasion of Britannia in a great battle outside Aquae Sulis. Thinking his mortally wounded brother the Emperor Constantine II should not be wasted, he had his Sarmatians sacrifice him to his Sword of Victory, now dedicated with the blood of two Emperors. In 342 CE Constantine of Britannia invaded Northern Gallia, and in 343 CE he defeated Maxentius II outside Lutetia, having the dead body of the Emperor sacrficed posthumously to his Sword, and proclaiming himself to be ""The Slayer of Emperors"". In 351 CE, following several succesfull campaigns, Rome finally fell to the Slayer of Emperors and a subservient senate hastened to proclaim him Emperor. His dominion over Rome did not last long for in 352 CE, on the 25th of December, the Dies Natalis Solis Invicti the Sun Emperor Alexandros VIII took the city by storm after Constantine had refused to abandon the city. Alexandros VIII had him sacrificed to Sol with his own infamous Sword of Victory, before sending his head and sword to his son Constantine II of Britannia, with a message to take good care of the sword for if he would not surrender it would be used in his sacrifice as well. In 365 CE, following a long war Constantine II was ultimately assassinated by conspirators led by Marcus Artorius, his head sent to Valentinian I as an offer of submission. Valentinian I would prove merciful allowing the young Constantine III of Britannia to retain Dumnonia as a client of the Empire. The Blood of Constantine have ruled over Dumnonia ever since, and have even provided the Brythons with several of their great High Kings, yet they have never forgotten the treachery of their Artorii relatives. Holding on to their Roman legacy, the Kings of Dumnonia believe that if the Empire is to be reforged, its rebuilding should start in Britannia and not elsewhere. The Blood of the Slayer of Emperors still carry his ancient Sword of Victory to Battle and hope that one day they will dedicate it with the Blood of their great enemies the Artorii and the Julio-Argeads and thus avenge their glorious ancestors. It is said that their ancient Sword will guide them to victory, to Rome and Constantinople, where one day the Blood of the Slayer of Emperors shall rule in triumph!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

He told them that: ""Here at the very end of the Earth slavery is a thing unknown, and we would do well to die as free men rather than be the slaves of Rome."" He famously finished his discourse by declaring that ""the Romans make a desert and call it peace"", a saying often repeated throughout history. Calgacus died that day with honor, surrounded, yet never surrendering, prefering death to slavery.

capet_desc;"The Capetians trace their descent from Robert the Strong, the first of their line to ascend the throne of Neustria. As Sovereign-Margrave of Neustria, Robert was one of the great feudal lords of the Empire, and following the collapse of Karling power during The First Great War of the Princes, he had himself crowned King. Following his successes in battle against the Vikings, Robert became known as the Strong and he would come to sire a long line of Kings. In spite of his greatness, the dynasty of Neustria now takes its name after Hugh Capet, one of his descendants. This is a result of Hugh's ephemereal elevation as High King of the Franks during his victorious war against the Karling kingdoms. Wielding the Sacred Oriflamme banner of Saint Denis, after having been gifted the banner by his ally, the Merovingian Charibert VIII, the very image of a Warrior King, Hugh led the armies of Neustria to countless victories. Fittingly in 996, Hugh died in battle, surrounded, yet never surrendering, cut down by his own treacherous nobles, even in death still holding on to the sacred Oriflamme banner, and thus ascending into legend. The Kings of Neustria honor his legacy as they go into battle shouting: ""Montjoie! Saint Denis!"" their Host following the Sacred Oriflamme to glory!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

After the confederation's breakup, Cech and his tribes crossed the Sudetes, eventually founding the city of Praha on the banks of Vltava river. From his new seat of power, Cech conducted expeditions against the Hungarians, Avars and Germans, until his death in 522 CE. His son Nezamysl led an ambitious intrusion into Roman lands in 552 CE, reaching the banks of the Mediterranean. Later on, his scions became engulfed in internal conflicts, ultimately being subjugated by the Moravians in the 9th century, but the breakup of Great Moravia in the 10th century gave Premysl the Pluoghman, a distant descendant of Cech, a chance to overthrow local Moravian administration and establish a new realm on his own. Even though the renewed Czech expansion had been halted in 987 CE, the blood of Cech remains the most vibrant and fiercesome force of the southern Slavs... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cerdic;Blood of Cerdic;;;;;;;;;;;x
cerdic_desc;This character is a descendant of Cerdic, the first King of Wessex. The establishment of Wessex started in 495 CE when Cerdic and his son Cynric began to slowly drive out the Brythons from the area that would later become the most famous Kingdom of the Saxons. Claiming descent from Woden himself, the Cerdicing kings of Wessex remained staunchly pagan refusing to convert to Christianity. While the Cerdicing kings consider themselves to be the rightful Bretwaldas of the Saxons, their power has fluctuated over the centuries. Many consider Alfred, Bretwalda of the Saxons to be the greatest of the Cerdicing kings, as a result of his victory in 878 CE over Gutrhum the Danish King of the Danelaw. His defeat of the Danes at Ethandun put an effective end to the expansion of the Danes into Western Britannia. A less fondly remembered Cerdicing is Edward the Martyr, the one Christian King of Wessex. His repeated attempts at converting his subjects failed miserably and earned him his death in 978 CE, when he was assassinated by his brother the pagan Aethelred, a deed met with great approval by the people. The West Saxons know that they are ruled by the Blood of Woden, and they would never tolerate such blasphemy! The Cerdicings of Wessex remember their divine heritage and uppon their ascension as Kings of the West Saxons are required to swear an Oath to drive the Christians into the Sea. While many Kings have failed this Oath so far, who is to say that a future King of Wessex might not succeed where the others have failed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

A sickly man, he was nonetheless appointed co-emperor by Diocletian, and in 296 CE, forced the rebel Maximus Artorius II to make peace with the Empire. Chlorus continued to campaign in Gaul and Britain, finally dying in 306 at the hands of the Picts. Never a zealot, his participation in the purges against Christianity consisted of knocking down two (abandoned) churches and being curt to a priest once. Chlorus was nonetheless blessed, for he produced three lines of rulers! But of these lines, the Konstantinians, descended from his grandson Cosntantius II, consider themselves the most pure of Chlorus' heirs. They do not profane themselves with barbaric ceremonies around a sword like the Constantinids of Dumnonia (descended from his grandson Constantine of Britannia), nor do they profess to personify a fictitious sun god like the Julianoi (descended from his third son Julius Constantius).

After the division of the kingdom during his grandson Rehoboam's reign, the southern kingdom of Judah continued to be ruled by the House of David until its conquest by the Babylonians. Despite this, the descendants of David survived, though not in power until after 135 CE. In that year, following the defeat of the bar Kokhba revolt in Judea and the expulsion of the Jews from that province, many were resettled in Sinai, where resettlement of Jews had started following the Jewish revolt of the preceding century, and a scion of the House of David was installed as Rome's client to keep them in order.\n\nIt has been prophesied that one of David's descendants shall be the messiah.

decebal;Blood of Decebalus;;;;;;;;;;;x
decebal_desc;Decebalus, The Brave, King of Dacia, ruled over a vast Dacian state from his great capital of Sarmizegetusa. In 87CE Decebalus destroyed 5 Roman legions at the battle of Tapae, thus earning himself the eternal enmity of Rome. Trajan defeated Decebalus in 102CE and Dacia had to become a client kingdom. As a client of Rome, Dacia became a militaritic buffer state of the Empire, and a recruiting ground for its legions. The Dacians owe their survival to the peculiar nature of their society. As a military client of the Empire, the Dacian state became increasingly more dedicated to warfare. The tarabostes, the warrior nobility, became a meritocratic class whose sole purpose was turned to martial excellence. The Cult of Zalmoxis became a monotheistic religion, with its disciples believing in an afterlife most easily earned by valor in battle. Zamolxianism became the religion of the state, and this warrior-mystical religion helped turn the Dacians into an unconquerable and fearless martial people. The Dacians hold death in contempt, and their fanatic falxmen expect their glorious place in the afterlife in every battle. Every year the Dacians send a warrior to Zalmoxis with their petitions, as he fearlessly throws himself from a great height onto the spears of the assembled host. It is said that Zalmoxis hears this supreme prayer and sends glorious thunder to signal his acceptance of his people's supplication. After gaining the approval of Heaven, the Dacian hosts march behind their Draco banners to the glory none can deny them!

fergus_desc;This character is a descendant of Fergus Mor, the legendary Progenitor of the Gabrains of Dal Riata. The Eastern line of the Gabrains centered their power around their great stronghold of Dun Chailleann, later called Dunkeld. While their Western relatives claim to be the senior line of the family, the Eastern Gabrains care little for this claim. Their power is greater, and the number of swords they command can do the talking for them! These Gabrains of Dun Chailleann as they have come to be called have held the High Kingship of Alba more times than the Western line in recent times and can safely claim to be the strongest descendants of the Blood of Fergus! While their power has diminished of late, the true Kings of Alba have the resources to humble all of the North, including their wayward Western cousins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
findlaech;Blood of Findláech;;;;;;;;;;;x
findlaech_desc;This character is a descendant of Findláech mac Ruaidrí, King of Moray and Fortriu. Findláech, King of Moray managed to become King of Fortriu and after several campaigns throughout the North he was acknowledged as High King of Alba. His rule was ephemereal, as he died at the hands of his own son Mac Bethad, Ri Deircc - the Red King. Mac Bethad would in turn become High King of Alba after assassinating all those who would oppose him. Widely accused of using witchcraft in order to further his ambitions, Mac Bethad openly took the title of The Witch King of Fortriu. Several lesser kings are said to have died as a result of his witchery, and even Duncan, the King of Alba is said to have succumbed to his unholy powers. Being true to his blood, his son Mac Bethad II assassinated his own father, also taking to the title of Witch King of Fortriu with relish. While the Blood of Findláech might have lost the High Kingship, their terrible reputation and fearful powers might very well help restore them to their rightful throne. Their enemies know that to defy them is to court death, for the evils the Blood of Findláech can unleash upon their enemies are legion! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gabran;Blood of Gabrán;;;;;;;;;;;x
gabran_desc;This character is a descendant of Gabrán mac Domangairt, King of Dál Riata. The blood of Gabrán ruled over the great Gaelic Kingdom of Dál Riata from the 6th century on. Several of the Kings of Dál Riata managed to be accepted as High Kings of Alba and ruled over the entire Northern part of the Island, if only in name. The greatest King of the blood of Gabráin, Áedán mac Gabráin tried to unify Alba, Hibernia and the Hen Ogledd into one great Northern State. His initial efforts were succesful as he came to dominate vast lands from Northern Hibernia to Ystrad Clud. In 603 CE, at the Battle of Degsastan, the self proclaimed High King of all the North met with defeat against a coallition of the Southern Lords. Áedán, refusing to abandon his dream died on the battlefield, it said after suffering no less than 33 wounds! While the power of the Gabrains was broken, their dream was not. The Kings of Dál Riata might seem like nothing more than petty kings to some, but they still remember their glorious ancestors and their sacred dream of a united North! As long as the Blood of Gabrán still flows in their veins, their dream is not dead, only dormant, ready to return in glory once the right King ascends their ancient throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gelimer;Blood of Gelimer;;;;;;;;;;;x
gelimer_desc;Gelimer, King of the Vandals and the Alans, Champion of Arianism defeated Belisarius at Ad Decimum in 533, thus ensuring the survival of the Vandal state. His dream of forging a Carthaginian Empire came very near to fruition. He ruled over a vast state controlling Carthage, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica and Southern Spain, but died assassinated in Carthago Nova, before he could proclaim himself Emperor. The Kings of Carthage slowly lost their Mediterranean conquests, but their vast maritime and commercial power assured their survival, even in the face of Muslim expansion. The blood of Gelimer yearns for revenge and remembers the great King's last words: Roma delenda est...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
guthrum;Blood of Guthrum;;;;;;;;;;;x
guthrum_desc;This character is a descendant of Guthrum, the great Danish King of the Danelaw. Guthrum's dream of a great kingdom of Daneland began by humbling the lesser Danish Lords of the East. By 874 CE he had consolidated his power over much of the Danelaw and declared himself as High King of the Danes in England. His campaigns of conquest took him further and further afield, till finally he met the host of Wessex. In 878 CE at Ethandun, Alfred of Wessex defeated in Guthrum in a contest that would become the inspiration of many a song. While Alfred defeated Guthrum, his power was by no means broken, and a treaty was signed between the Danes and the Saxons, with the Great King of the Danelaw holding on to his Eastern dominions. Guthrum's later conversion to Christianity was a calculated move aimed at securing his possessions, a move which proved highly succesful, as the Christian Saxon kings surrounding his lands could stomach a Christian Danish kingdom easier than a pagan one. His Blood still rule over the great Kingdom of Daneland, although they have yet to imitate their great ancestor. While their glory might only be heard in song, they are ever ready to grasp it once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

halfdan_desc;This character is a descendant of Halfdan Ragnarsson, the great Norse King of Yorvik. The lesser known son of Ragnar Lodbrok, Halfdan was one of the commanders of the Great Norse Army that ravaged the British Isles in the 9th century CE. While his brothers hogged the glory, Halfdan saw to his conquests. He humbled many Saxon Kings, including Alfred in a great battle near Reading. His rule had many ups and downs and saw him in control of many great cities, including Londinium, before losing them to his many enemies. Widely feared for his cruelty, and reportedly putting even his brother Ivar to shame on that account, Halfdan lost his many domains, and would only manage to hold on to Jorvik. His blood have held on to this great Norse Kingdom ever since and to this day remain the terror of the Isles. Their Raven Banners set fear in the hearts of their enemies, for all who oppose them know that when the Ravens come calling, the Blood Eagles spread throughout the Land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hengist_desc;"This character is a descendant of the 5th century Saxon warlord Hengist. Hengist was one of the leaders of the Germanic invasion of Britannia, and eventually the first King of the British Saxons. He is widely considered to be the ""Father of the Country"" by the Saxons of the Island and all Saxon kings without fail trace their lineage to him in some manner. While Hengist could not acquire much land from the Brythons, barely holding dominion over what would later become Kent, he remained infamous for the ""Brad y Cyllyll Hirion"" - the Treachery of the Long Knives. At a famous council meeting, Hengist had several British sub-kings and lords treacherously murdered, after his supposedly unarmed Saxons hid knives in their shoes. In spite of his treacherous ways, Hengist managed to hold on to his territories in South Eastern England and Britannia was changed forever! His bloodline would go on to sire a great many Kings, both saintly and murderous, but none without ambition, for ambition burns within their very blood!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hieron;Blood of Hieron;;;;;;;;;;;x
hieron_desc;This character is a descendant of Hieron II, King of Syracuse and ally to Rome against the Carthaginians. Hieron was preceded by Agothocles who had united the island, but his death created a succession crisis. Taking advantage of the situation, mercenaries called the Mamertines gained control of the north east of the island with their base at Massinia. Hieron emerged from the succession crisis and defeated the Mamertines at Mylae, gaining control of the whole of Sicily. \nThe true test of his reign would come at the speartips of the Sacred Band of Carthage. Hieron requested aid from Rome, thus sparking the first Punic war. Driving the Carthaginians from Sicily the two nations signed a treaty of eternal alliance. The Hieronids would continue to provide Rome with ships and men in their many wars, but the occupation of the Vandals and Muslims have left the island Kingdom weak. Will the scions of Hieron once again spread their rule across their island home and beyond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ivar_desc;This character is a descendant of Ivar the Boneless, son of Ragnar Lodbrok. Ivar, the Scourge of the Islands, was one of the leaders of the Norse attacks in Britannia in the middle of the 9th century CE. Ivar campaigned throughout the Islands humbling many kings from the petty Kings of Hibernia to great Kings such as Aella the High King of Northanhymbra. His legendary cruelty saw many captured Kings blood-eagled - their ribs cut off by the spine, then broken on their back, so as to resemble blood-stained wings, their lungs pulled out through the wounds in their back - in order to subdue the rest. The pale skinned Ivar became a figure of great dread and his strange sickness made many whisper of his unnatural condition. It is said that his very bones melted in the end, yet his body would not decay. While some believe that his uncorrupt body was burned in a great pyre, others believe that Ivar was sent to the bottom of the Sea and will one day rise up again to terrorize all of the Islands! His Blood remains strong, and many kings, from Bernicia, to the Isles to Dubhlin, hail Ivar as their legendary sire. They all know that their Blood carries great power, and they all hear the whispers of their great ancestor! None of the Ivarrings believe him to be gone forever, and all await his return from the Sea! Woe to the Lands of Man, when Ivar the Boneless will come again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

julianos_desc;"Flavius Claudius Julianus Augustus, blood of Constantine and Augustus on his mother's side, Sol Invictus made flesh and Savior of the Light, was a true philosopher-king the likes of which the Romans have never seen again. Invincible in battle, Julian humbled all who opposed him, from the barbaric Alamanni and Franks to the Sassanids of Persia. His complete victory over the Christian Infidels and Sacred policies of Purification of the Eastern Empire were an inspiration for many Emperors to come, as Christianity and other barbaric cults were humbled by the Invincible Light of Sol. Although his descendants lost the throne, Aurelian II, the True Restorer of the World, a descendant of the great Aurelian on the maternal side, managed to regain it and on the 25th of December 932CE, the very date of the Dies Natalis Sol Invicti, the Birthday of Sol Invictus, he entered Constantinople in triumph and restored the blood of Julian to its rightful place of Glory. The Sun Emperors of Constantinople dedicate their rule to ""Inventori Lucis Soli Invicto Augusto"" - to the Creator of Light, Sol Invictus Augustus, and await his return, for the Sun will be made flesh once more in the very person of the Emperor and the Light shall banish the Darkness from the world of Man!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

kahina_desc;"The Berber Queen Daya Ult Yenfaq Tajrawt, known to the world as Kahina led the Berber resistence against Islam in North Africa. Claiming descent from the Antonii Amanai Berber Princes the Great Warrior Queen of the Berbers proved worthy of her Roman and Divine blood both. Her many victories against Islam and preternatural military talent earned her a reputation for sorcery among the Muslims. In 692 Kahina destroyed a great Islamic army near Biskra and had all captives decapitated, their bodies left to rot on the field. This earned her the dread name of ""Gatherer of Heads"" among the Arabs. Furthermore in 695 Kahina defeated the great Islamic general Hasan ibn al-Numan greatly weakening Islam in North Africa. The Queen swore never to rest till Islam had not been purged from Africa. In 710 CE, the Kahinid prince Amnay founded the Kingdom of Nekor and her descendants have ruled it ever since. Unbent and unbroken, the Berber Kings of Nekor are reputed for their invincible exploits on the battlefield and their talent for sorcery. Arabs and other Berbers alike fear the Sorceror Kings of Nekor and avoid campaigning against their Mountain strongholds. Upon their acension as King, the Kahinid princes are ritually remembered of the Oath of Kahina, and swear never to rest till Islam is purged from Africa.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

karling_desc;Karolus Magnus, King of the Franks and Imperator Romanorum ruled over a vast, yet fragile Empire. A major architect of this Empire was Pope Leo III, exiled from Rome by the proper Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius V, the Pope went to the court of the Frankish King and persuaded him to wage a Crusade against the Unholy Empire now found in Rome. In order to give legitimacy to the enterprise Leo had Karolus crowned Sacred Roman Emperor and proclaimed the birth of a new Holy Roman Empire! The crusading armies of this new Holy Roman Empire marched on Rome, but in 802 at the battle of Pavia, an allied Roman coalition led by the Mithraic host of Ravenna defeated the Franks and sent them back over the Alps. The Empire of Karolus Magnus remained a fragmented theoretical state, and upon his death it split into many lesser kingdoms paying only lip service to the new Sacral Emperor reigning in Aachen. The main Karling line retained the fiction of their Holy Roman Imperial title, but little power outside the walls of their Sacral capital. The lesser lines of the Pepinid Karlings and Lotharing Karlings ruling over Austrasia and Lotharingia retain vastly more power than their theoretical overlord. The Emperor himself is nothing but a shadow of the great Karolus, with the great nobility of his inexistent Empire bowing before him in public, yet laughing behind his back. A Karling Restoration is the dream of every Sacral Emperor, and even the lesser bloodlines of the Karlings share it... yet such a dream might be beyond the powers of mere mortal men. A True Sacred Emperor, Karolus Reborn, might be the only one able to fulfill such glory! Can there be such a One? It is the Karling's sacred destiny to find out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

According to a popular legend, he and his two sons defeated a mighty dragon living beneath hill Wawel, thus earning the nickname ""Dragonslayers"". Under Krak's dynasty's reign, Kraków became a wealthy trade hub, arguably the richest Slavic town north of the Carpathians. In 986 CE prince Krak IV defeated the Piast incursion, killing prince Mieszko in personal combat.

In 167 BCE his father Mattathias began a rebellion against the cruel policies of the Seleukids, but died within a year, leaving Judah to pick up his father's torch. Judah did not falter, and lead the Chosen people to victory after victory over the Seleukids, joining the ranks of Joshua, Gideon, and David as one of Israelfs greatest heroes! \nWhen Seleukid strength proved too much, Judah invited in the Romans, who helped force King Demetrius to recognize Judah as King of Judea in 160 BCE, although the following year Judah was treacherously killed while in prayer, likely on Demetrius's orders. The star of the Hasmoneans has since fallen, but it has not disappeared. From their citadel in Beersheb the heirs of Judah pray to Yahweh Sabaoth for victory over the infidels who now lord over Israel. Soon, the idolaters will once again know to fear the Sledgehammer of Judea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

maelgwn_desc;This character is a descendant of Maelgwn ap Cadwallon, King of Gwynedd and High King of the Brythons. Maelgwn remains a legendary character among the Brythons, partly because of Taliesin the Bard, his son-in-law and court bard. Immortalized in the great songs of the Brythons, Maelgwn is widely remembered as the High Dragon of the North, and Great King of the Hen Ogledd. An Artorian and Constantinid on the maternal lines, Maelgwn was one of the chief supporters of Christianity in Brythonia. His support of Christianity turned the Pagan Brythons against him, and the Dragon of the Island found his death at the hand of the Pagan priesthood, burned alive as a sacrifice to the old gods. His descendants turned Gwynedd into a bastion of Christianity, while still allowing the druids of Ynis Mon their traditional rights over the Island. The Kings of Gwynedd might not be considered a great power among the Kings of the Island, but their strongholds remain impregnable, from this position of strength they can safely plot the downfall of their many enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

mathrafal_desc;This character is a descendant of Rhodri ap Mawr, the Great, King of Powys and High King of the Brythons. An Artorian of the Royal line of Powys, Rhodri proved worthy of his blood winning many famous victories over the Norse. He was rewarded for his victories and the sacrifice of 101 Norse prisoners to a Sword of Victory, in the ancient Artorian fashion, by being elected High King of the Brythons. Ever impulsive and fearless, Rhodri died in battle against the Norse after charging their line alone, with his troops refusing to fight a greatly superior enemy. His death would inspire his army to victory and the name of Rhodri the Great would become a rallying cry against any subsequent Norse invasion. His senior bloodline rule over Powys, from the ancient seat of their power, the great stronghold of Mathrafal, seat of the High Kings of Old. They remain unconquerable and true to their ancestor's blood, as they bow to no man, no matter his power or earthly glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
merovingian;Blood of Merovech;;;;;;;;;;;x
merovingian_desc;The Merovingian Kings of Francia trace their descent from Merovech and Clovis I, the first great Christian King of the Franks. Their Holy Sang Real has ruled over the Franks for hundreds of years, although many of those years were spent as figure-heads, with overpowerful Mayors of the Palace being the actual power of the realm. The Karlings kept the Sang Real on a tight leash, the Merovingian Kings being in truth less than minor aristocrats in their new capital of Paris. Providing little besides overglorified marriage partners for the Karlings and other more powerful dynasties, the Merovingians could have dissapeared into complete irrelevance. Yet this was not to be. Following the great fragmentation of the Karling Empire and The Third Great War of the Princes, an able scion of the Sang Real rose to great power among the feudal nobles of the Holy Roman Empire. His name was Clovis VI and through his marriage to the Karling princess Adelheid, a well-engineered network of alliances, and undisputed martial genious, this later-day Clovis rebuilt a kingdom for his sacred bloodline. Under his descendants, this Sacral Frankish Kingdom became ever more of a theocracy than a feudal state. The Kings of the Sang Real are considered Holy by their subjects and are said to be able to ritually cure sickness by laying on hands. Ever greater belief in their Sacred Mission meant the Merovingians split with Rome establishing their own Gallic Church, based upon the Mystery of the Sang Real and the divine destiny of its heirs. It is said that a Ruler of the Holy Blood will one day rule the world, for the world belongs to the Sacred Sang Real, now and forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Mithridates began the expansion of his kingdom by seizing Bythinia to the west, following which the Hellens of Asia Minor submitted to this growing power. Soon after, Mithridates would take advantage of the civil war in Rome between Sulla and Marius, invading the client state of Makedonia. Once in Pella, Mithridates proclaimed himself Megas Basileus and continued his campaign south, defeating the Spartan and Athenian army at Pydna, where the Spartans, refusing to surrender, were killed to a man. He would continue to win victories against both Hellenic and Roman forces until he would finally be defeated by Gnaeus Pompeius and King Deiotarus of Galatia. \nForced to flee to his son's kingdom of Cimmerian Bosphorus, he was pursued by Pompeius who soundly defeated the Pontic army. Mithidates son, Machares, betrayed and murdered his father hoping to cater favor with Rome. However Pompeius executed Machares for fratricide and installed Mithidates VII as a Roman client in Pontus, whose descendants still rule over Pontus. But with the current state of affairs in the Empire, will they be able to once again claim the title Megas Basileus?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In 657 CE Muawiyah fought Ali in the great Battle of Siffin, a key moment in the dissolution of Islamic unity. The arbitration following the indecisive battle, spelled the beginning of the End for the Rashidun Caliphate. Following Ali's assassination by a Kharijite, Muawiyah became Caliph and ruled over much of the Islamic Realm from Damascus. In 670 CE, Alexandros XVI entreated him to attack Persia, wishing to see him humbled in the process, but his plan backfired as Muawiyah conquered Ctesiphon and had the Persians expelled from Mesopotamia. Alexandros famously proclaimed: ""Never trust a Persian to do your business."" The later years of his rule so the Great Fragmentation of Islam and collapse of any form of central authority. He died assassinated in 680, his death causing further Islamic disunity. In 750 CE Umayyad power in the East collapsed entirely following their defeat in the Battle of the Zab by the new Abbasid Caliphate. The Umayyad Caliph Marwan II barely managed to flee to Damascus and retain rule over the city and its environs. In 755 CE, the Umayyad Abd-ar-Rahman went to Hispania, thus inaugurating the Great Umayyad adventure in the West, culminating in the Establishment of the Caliphate of Cordoba. The Umayyads went on to become great patrons of Ilm, their realms being renowned for their tolerance, scientific advances and patronage of art. The Umayyads might have lost their former glory, but as patrons of Light in a world of Darkness, they still hope that one day they will regain what is rightfully theirs. Maybe, a day will come when Ilm will be the guiding principle of Islam once more, and the Umayyad Caliphs will once more be the focus of the prayers of the faithful, from Mecca to Cordoba and beyond!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

With his Kingdom bordering the Brython lands, Offa decided to ally himself with his Western neighbors and in 757 CE he married the Artorian princess Axyra. The Offaning line thus became to be known by many as the ""Saxon Artorii"". Following an elaborate diplomatic policy Offa of Mercia managed to become Bretwalda of the Saxons in 765 CE. He would rule in peace establishing good relations with the High Kings of Brythonia and Northanhymbra. Mostly concerning himself with internal affairs, Offa established a great system of burghs within his realm, while his monetary policies saw his coins being used in international commerce, his gold coins making their way as far East as the Abbasid Caliphate! Offa the Good died assassinated by his own son Ecgfrith, who would come to lose the High Kingship and his life on account of his later proven patricide. The Offanings rule over Mercia to this day, accused by some to be more Brython than Saxon, the Kings of Mercia have intermarried into the Brython noble families and are seen by many to be more Artorii than anything else. They are renowned for their great administrative skills, and many believe that an Offaning High King might one day bring back the prosperity of old to Britannia and beyond!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In 912 Oleg, Bane of the Rhomaion, assembled a great Varangian host and went South to besiege Miklagard itself. Unable to penetrate the great walls of the Imperial City, Oleg fixed his shield to the gate of the city. It is said that a prophecy foretold that Oleg would find his death from his own stallion, and so he sent it away, and many years later when the horse had died, he finally went to see its remains. As Oleg touched the skull of his stallion, a snake slithered from inside the skull and bit him. Thus Oleg died fulfilling the prophecy. His descendants are still credited with great oracular power, and are prone to call themselves ""The Seer Princes"" of Kiev. While their dominion is much diminished the Olegovichs of Kiev are still feared by their enemies as they cling on to power in the Seer's capital. The Princes of Kiev have overcome many misfortuners, and have remained steadfast in their resolve, for it is foretold that one day, a King of the Blood of Oleg will march once more on Miklagard and he will affix his shield on the very doors of the Imperial Palace!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
oswald;Blood of Oswald;;;;;;;;;;;x
oswald_desc;This character is a descendant of Oswald the Great, the Divine Ruler and King of Northumbria. Oswald was a man of great ambition. His claim of being the Son of God, his unequalled charisma and his merging of Christian and pagan beliefs into a powerful royal cult, turned many nobles to his cause. His campaigns of unification brought the North under his rule and in 610 CE, Oswald proclaimed himself Bretwalda, fighting an indecisive war with Raedwald of East Anglia over the High Kingship. This war would prove to be the beginning of the end for the unity of the High Kingdom of the Saxons. Widely acknowledged as the Divine Ruler of the North, Oswald managed to became Bretwalda in truth in 632 CE. Following his death, his body remained uncorrupt. With his divinity proven, Oswald's remains became the focus of an important Saxon cult, his descendants later carrying his Invincible Right hand into battle as a relic guaranteeing victory. In 650 CE the split between the South and North would become permanent, as his descendant Oswiu of Northanhymbra, supported by the Britano-Sarmatian High King Riothamus III Artorius, proclaimed himself High King of the North, thus splitting Saxon dominions in half, creating the long lasting status-quo of the Three Kingdoms in Britannia. The Divine Blood of the Oswaldings is seen by many to this very day as the rightful Ruling Blood of the North, and the heirs of Oswald still dream of carrying their ancestor's Hand into glorious battle, to reestablish their rightful dominion over the North and beyond!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

While some whisper that his steadfast command of the left at the Battle of Issus was the true key to success in that most famous of battles, others choose to remember him for his advice before the battle of Gaugamela. Darius had sent an emissary offering Alexandros half of his entire empire in exchange for peace... Parmenion opined that if he were Alexander, he would have gladly accepted the offer. Alexander only replied, ""And I would too, if I were Parmenion."" The bloodline of Parmenion became Satraps of Ecbatana and stubbornly held on to it as they mastered the art of bowing before the most powerful ruler of the day. Their greatest moment came towards the end of the Seleukid Renaissance. In 102CE Philotas XII, after a famous victory near Arsakia Rhagae, humbled his Parthian Overlord and went on to crown himself King of Media. After a series of whirlwind campaigns, Philotas, now king of Media, Atropatene and Hayasdan marched upon Seleukeia on the Tigris and entered the city in triumph as the Seleukid Basileus Antiochus XVI Epiphanes chose not to give battle. Great celebrations were planned to mark the Restauration of a Hellenic Persian Empire, but on that very night Philotas XII the Conqueror, died chocking on a poisoned cup of wine, and the dream of a restored Arche Makedonia died with him.

Then he took the old Lechitic stronghold of Gniezno as his captal. Under Piast's rule, the Polans began an ambitious attempt to restore the legendary realm of Lech. This dream came to an end in 986 CE, when prince Mieszko was killed in the battle of Kraków by Krakovian ruler Krak IV.

After Popiel got slain by Piast inside his islandic hold on lake Goplo, his only son Gniewomir fled east, ultimately finding refuge on the east bank of Vistula. The restored Popielid principality, led by Popiel's grandson Lech, campaigned against Piast prince Lestek in 889 CE, reestablishing control over the lands of Kuyavia. Thus the rising star of the Piasts has been counterbalanced for the time being - but Lech's untimely death in 891 CE almost resulted in the Popielid realm being divided between his twin brothers Popiel II and Skarbimir.

Kyrene became an impregnable bastion of the Ptolemaioi, a highly fortified and developed realm sustained by a powerful professional military, and even Muslim expansion could not dislodge the proud Hellenes from their seat of power. Upon their elevation to the throne, the Ptolemaioi of Kyrene adopt the sacred praenomen of Userkhaenre Meryamun  - Who is made strong through the ka of Re, beloved of Amun- the ancient name of Ptolemaîos Philádelphos, for it was prophesized that He would ride back in glory to Alexandria and beyond!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Defeated by Riothamus II Artorius, the High King of the Brythons the two acknowledged each other as High Kings, one ruling over the West, the other over the East.

Rognvald the Wise, a favored companion of the great Norse King Harald Fairhair went on many viking expeditions, from the Volga to the Mediterranean! After having achieved great riches during his many travels, Rognvald returned to the North, desiring to establish a Realm of his own. He set his sights on Orkney and with the help of his viking companions the islands were soon his. The Jarls of Orkney hold themselves to be Kings in their own lands, and have for many years coveted the title of Kings of the North. Their attempts at subduing the Picts and Scots have innevitably failed, yet the Great Jarls of Orkney remain the unquestioned power of the Eastern Isles. While many of the Jarls of Orkney seem more concerned with plunder than expansion, their blood still yearns for dominion over the Northern Lands, and the true Blood of Rognvald know that only riches earned from great plunder can bring them the power they need to subdue their errant neighbors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rurik;Blood of Rurik;;;;;;;;;;;x
rurik_desc;Rurik, the Varangian Prince of Holmgardr established a strong Norse state centered around his newly founded capital. One of many Varangian warlords to try their hand at conquest in the East, Rurik's legacy proved to be the most lasting. His heir Ingvar of Holmgardr was acknowledged by the other Varangian Princes as King of Gardariki. His great Varangian host besieged Miklagard on two ocassions in 941 and 944. Not content with his exploits on the Black Sea, Ingvar terrorized the Caspian as well, his Varangians launching a major expedition into Persia and sacking the great city of Arsakia Rhagae. Inspite of his glorious exploits, Ingvar met with an undignified end, as the Drevlyans captured him while attempting to collect tribute. The Drevlyans bent down two birch trees to the ground and tied them to Ingvar's legs, and then they let the trees straighten, thus tearing him apart. His wife Olga extracted merciless revenge, burning their capital of Iskorosten and then salting its very ground, then leveling their other towns so that nothing remained of them, while all Drevlyan men were put to the sword. Rurik's blood lost the High Kingship, but his descendants continued to reign in Holmgardr and elsewhere. After several expeditions to Miklagard, and with many of their warriors having served in the Rhomaion Varangian Guard, the Princes of Holmgardr adopted Ódinn-Sól as their patron, their very own version of Sol Invictus. It is their dream to build a great Empire of the North, a Third Rome under the auspices of their Invincible Sun, and then one day with the whole might of Gardariki descend upon Miklagard in victory and march on to even greater glory, to Rome and beyond!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rus;Blood of Rus;;;;;;;;;;;x
rus_desc;This character is a descendant of Rus, the youngest of three brothers who lead the conquest of Gothic lands in the 5th century CE. After the breakup of the Slavic tribal confederation, Rus returned east, taking up lands between the Bug and Dnieper rivers. After his death in 541 CE his oldest son, Vladislav, crossed the Dnieper and attempted to conquer all the lands up to Volga, while the younger Rus lead his tribes against Bosphorian Cimmeria and Crimean Goths, although he was repelled in the great battle at the banks of Tanais. Rus' descendants established numerous smaller states, fighting the surrounding Baltic, Ugro-Finnic and Altaic tribes, as well as between one another. After his arrival in 864 CE, Rurik and the Varangians managed to use the internal strives and political splintering to their advantage, ousting Rus' descendants and replacing them with Varangian nobility. Unwilling to accept Nordic overlordship, a group of nobles led by Sviatoslav III retreated west, entrenching themselves along the Danastris river. The blood of Rus needs both time and luck to regain what has been lost... Or else it will disappear, assimilated by Russia's new masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
samo;Blood of Samo;;;;;;;;;;;x
samo_desc;"This character is a descendant of Samo the Great, the First High King and Emperor of the Western Slavs. Samo was not a Slav, but a merchant of Frankish descent. As a supplier of weapons to the Slavs, and as a result of his great personal charisma, Samo came to be elected as High King by the Slavs of Moravia and Slovakia, in their attempt to unite against the Avars. Samo increased his authority over the Western Slavic lands by marrying the daughters of many Slavic princes. He had over twelve wives and fathered twenty two legitimate sons and fifteen daughters by his wives. His progeny by concubines or lovers is myriad! This true father of Western Slavic royalty managed to unite the Western Slavs into their own primitive version of an Empire, a great state that would later come to be called Great Moravia. Humbling all who would oppose him, from the Avars to the Germans and the Franks, Samo crowned himself Emperor in immitation of the Romans, and proved to be an inspiration for many later Slavic monarchs, in truth most descending from him, if only on the maternal side. His descendants squandered his legacy and lost their ""Empire"" and thus turned to the worship of Veles in their great bitterness. The Samonids of Nyitra are greatly feared by their enemies, for they know no mercy or restraint! Even their Ahrimanist Avar neighbors know that to anger the Samonids is something not to be done! The Samonids are more than glad to sacrifice their beaten enemies to their Cruel God, ever beseaching him to grant their Return to the Great Glory of Old! Their enemies should beware, for the Blood of Samo can never be extinguished!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sassanid;Blood of Sassan;;;;;;;;;;;x
sassanid_desc;"From Estakr, Ardashir I, blood of Sassan and Darius the Achaemenid, built an Empire and swore to bring the world under the dominion of Ahura Mazda. The glory of the Realm of Light knew no equal on this world and Kings from Sindhia to the shores of the Inner Sea prostrated themselves before the glory of the Light. Yet Angra Mainyu saw fit to test the steadfastness of the Sovereigns of Light and a great darkness arose from Arabia to challenge the Realm of Ahura Mazda. It was Yazdegird III who stopped those who would destroy the Realm of Light and in 636CE at the Battle of al-Qadisiyyah Ahura Mazda emerged victorious. The Empire was saved, only to fall pray to internal dissension as the centuries weakened the blood of the Sovereigns of Light. Yet, in Estakhr, the blood of Sassan remains strong and the Lords of Light still whisper: ""With me is the Derafsh Kavian, through which I shall rule the nations.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
seleukos;Blood of Seleukos;;;;;;;;;;;x
seleukos_desc;Seleukos I Nikator, blood of Apollo, built an Empire and his descendants squandered it. The Seleukidai came close to extinction but the young Antiochus XIII Soter defeated Tigranes near Antiocheia ad Taurus in 83BCE, sparkling the beginning of a Seleukid Renaissance. Antiochus XIII Soter brought Tigranes's Armenian Empire to its knees, then after a series of successful campaigns in the East, he had himself proclaimed a second Alexandros after a triumphal entry into Seleukeia on the Tigris, the ancient capital of Arche Seleukeia. The Seleukid Renaissance ended in 116CE when Antiochus XVI Epiphanes bent the knee before a victorious Trajan and accepted Roman sovereignty. Seleukid Syria survived as a Roman vassal and later became a buffer state between the Romans and Islam. The blood of divine Seleukos is restless and wishes its glory restored!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
severus;Blood of Severus;;;;;;;;;;;x
severus_desc;"Lucius Septimius Severus Augustus started his carreer by campaigning against the Great Abgar Ix of Osroene. He humbled the Armenian Emperor and had him result his role as a petty client of Rome. Following his victories in the East Severus was sent to Hispania to put down a Lusitanian rebellion. In 192 CE, following the death of Commodus, his legions procalimed him Emperor in Hispania. He became a member of the Imperial Triumvirate alongside Clodius Albinus and Alexandros III, his control over Hispania and Africa being confirmed. In 200 CE, while in Rome, Septimius Severus attempted to have himself crowned sole Emperor, and after the refusal of the Senate, he had it disbanded thus sparking the War of the Three Emperors. The Great Champion of the Republicans, Clodius Albinus expelled Severus from Rome and then chased him into Hispania. At the end of the war in 210 CE Alexandros III acknowledged Septimius Severus as Emperor of Hispania, thus starting the long rule of the Severi over their Hispanic possessions, and inaugurating the long lived political entity of the Empire of Hispania. On his deathbed Severus told his sons Geta and Caracalla: ""Be harmonious, make sure to enrich the soldiers, and scorn all other men."" and the Severi have taken this to heart, managing to survive the centuries on pure military strength alone. The Severi slowly lost their hold over Hispania, and in 553 CE Valentia submmited to Belisarius. Justinian had Marius Severus confirmed as hereditary Exarch of Valentia, and thus the once proud Emperors became the unbreakable Exarchs of the West. The Empire of Hispania lived on, as many Gothic High Kings claimed the title for their own. In 707 CE Julius Severus broke off with the Empire proclaiming himself King of Valentia, and the Severi became once more masters of an independent power. Having survived many centuries of adversity, Vandals, Goths and the Rise of Islam, the Severi still hold on to their Kingdom of Valentia and dream of the Empire that is rightfully theirs. With the Immortal Legio VI Hispana at their command, and their great militaristic state ready to raise more legions for their masters, the Severi are ready to once more claim the Empire of Hispania as their own, and if Mithra is willing one day return to Rome and punish the Senate for its ancient, yet never forgiven insolence!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sweyn;Blood of Sweyn;;;;;;;;;;;x
sweyn_desc;This character is a descendant of Sweyn Forkbeard, High King of the Danes and High King of Anglia. In 986 CE Sweyn managed to secure the High Kingship of the Danes and went on to increase his dominions wherever he could, from Norway to the Isles of the West! In 1003 CE Sweyn led the largest Norse invasion force Britannia had ever seen in an attempt to overwhelm all resistance. King after King swore fealty to the new Danish High King, and in 1005 CE he was acknowledged as the uncontested High King of the Saxons and the Norse of Britannia. In 1007 CE, his Western advances were checked at the battle of Glevum, Brennius Pendragon, High King of the Brythons soundly defeating his great Norse army. The following peace confirmed Sweyn as Overlord of the Saxons and of the Norse, while abandoning all claims on the Brython lands. Sweyn died in 1015 CE, and his realm was plunged into a great civil war with several Kings vying for the High Kingship. His son Knut would eventually emerge victorious. Knut the Great would prove an even better ruler than his father. Having served in the Varangian Guard in Constantinople in his youth, Knut returned home with great ambitions of Empire. In immitation of the Romans, he adopted Sowilo, the Sun God as a patron of his great state. Knut wold go on to establish his dominion not only over the Norse and Saxons of Briannia but over Denmark, Sweden and Norway as well. The Great Sun Emperor of the North, managed to build his great state of Miklaríki holding dominion from the Baltic to Iceland! His great Realm proved to be ephemereal, for upon Knut's death his Empire collapsed into chaos and anarchy. His descendants might rule many realms, yet all remain but shadows of their great ancestors. Will the Blood of Sweyn rebuild its Great Empire of the North, or will Miklaríki remain but a half-remembered dream? Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
theodemir;Blood of Theodemir;;;;;;;;;;;x
theodemir_desc;This character is a descendant of the Amali High King Theodemir, the father of the Great Theodoric, and sire of several long lines of Kings. The Blood of Theodemir ruled many kingdoms from the Balkans to Hispania, and found its way into many dynasties on the maternal line. While Theodoric went West, several branches of the family remained in the east. The Blood of Theodemir retained the High Kingship of the Balkan Ostrogoths, and in 504 CE Leo II created the Kingdom of Diocleia for his Ostrogothic clients. The Kingdom of Diocleia became the primary Ostrogothic recruiting ground for the Empire, these Eastern Goths found themselves fighting under the Imperial Banner in battlefields ranging from Hispania to Persia. Their proud warrior culture and excellence in the art of war saw them settled as military colonists throughout the Empire, wherever a Gothic sword was needed. The Blood of Theodemir retain the martial spirit of their ancestors and remain unconquered in their strongholds on the Adriatic Sea. The Theodemirings no longer serve the Empire, and are now free to find their own glory! They still remember the Great High Kings of Old and know that Rome was once humbled by the Goths, and it can be so again. Their will is iron, their resolve steel and their desire unending!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
theodoric;Blood of Theodoric;;;;;;;;;;;x
theodoric_desc;This person is of the blood of Theodoric the Great, son of Theodemir and the only man to ever rule over all Goths, Ostro- and Visi- alike. In 478 CE Theodoric forced the Celtic kings of Tylis and Singidunum to accept his authority over that of Constantinoplefs. Leaving his brother Theodemir II to rule the Balkans in his name, Theodoric traveled west, attacking the Western Empire on the suggestion of Emperor Zeno. Though he failed, he simply went further west, uniting the disparate Goths of Southern Gallia. He was then invited by the Visigoths to be regent, for the Balthing king Amalric was too young to rule. \nWhen the Tervingi king protested this, Theodoric simply invited him to a banquet and had a toast with him, then strangled the Visigoth with his own two hands! And while not even Theodoric could stand against Clovis of the Franks, he was also one of the few men who could speak his mind around the infamously ruthless Merovingian. Theodoric was finally betrayed by his daughter Amalasuntha and killed in 515 CE. Though his empire did not outlast him, the Kings of Aquitaine still look to Theodoric as the great champion of Gothic Arianism. Even the Tieudiskaz respect and honor him, knowing him as Dietrich of Bern. And from Alcantara all the way to Crimea, Goths everywhere know that one man almost forged them into an empire capable of rivaling Rome. If not for an ungrateful brat of a daughter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
theodosius;Blood of Theodosius;;;;;;;;;;;x
theodosius_desc;This character is a descendant of Flavius Theodosius, who reigned as co-emperor alongside Valentinian II. It was during his reign that Christianity was instituted as the state religion of the Western Empire. In 382 CE, Theodosius ordered the destruction of the Temple of the Vestal Virgins and the defilement of the Sacred Heart of Sol, enraging Julian II in the process. Julian then invaded the West and conquered the city of Rome within three months. Valentinian and Theodosius regrouped at Ravenna where they were beaten again by Julian. Following this, they fled first to Gallia and then Hispania, where Theodosius instigated the foederati and other barbarian tribes to invade the Empire. In 387 CE, Julian was mortally wounded and so embarked upon his final journey into the desert. By this time Valentinian and Theodosius had gathered the support of the Severans of the Hispania, which they then used to re-establish their authority in the Western Empire. Because of tensions between the Eastern Empire and the Persians, Theodosius made peace with Alexandros IX who is now the sole emperor of the East. Theodosius died in 395 CE of sun stroke, to which Alexandros replied is only fitting. He was then succeeded by his son Honorius as co-emperor. However the true ruler of the Western Empire becomes the half-Vandal general Stilicho. Honorius later moved his capital to Ravenna, where his descendants still reign today. With the power of the Western Emperor broken, will the Blood of Theodosius once again reclaim their Empire?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
urien;Blood of Urien;;;;;;;;;;;x
urien_desc;This character is a descendant of Urien Rheged, King of Rheged and Sovereign Lord of the Hen Ogledd. One of the legendary Battle-Leaders of the Brythons, Urien of Rheged imposed his authority over the Old North and was acknowledged as High King by the Brythons of the Hen Ogledd. Invincible in battle and widely respected by the Brythons, Urien married the Artorian princess Morgana, and together they would sire a long line of kings. Morgana would later kill her husband and rule as Queen in her own right over Rheged and the Men of the North. While it is said that the Saxons of the South are steel, the Men of the North are stone. Unconquered and unbreakable the Kings of Rheged wish to restore their dominion over the Hen Ogledd and banish the Norse and the Saxons into the Sea. With the Blood of Urien and Artorius in their veins, the true Kings of the North are prophesiezed to regain their High Kingship and bring the dominion of the Gwyr y Gogledd - the Men of the North - over all of the great Islands of the West!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
valentinian;Blood of Valentinian;;;;;;;;;;;x
valentinian_desc;This character is a descendant of Flavius Valentinianus, who reigned as co-emperor alongside Julian II and Alexandros VIII. Early in his career, Valentinian was delivered a surprise victory over Constantine II of Britannia due to what can only be described as divine intervention. He promptly converted to Christianity. Emboldened by his victories in Britannia, Valentinian decided to split the empire in two: he and his brother Valens ruled in the West, whilst Julian and Alexandros ruled in the East. The rising persecution of Christians in the Eastern Empire enraged Valentinian and forced him to forge an alliance with Shapur II of the Persian Empire, who then proceeded to invade the Eastern Empire from the East. After a failed siege at Constantinople Valentinian met Julian in battle again, this time outside Athens. It was here that Valentinian fell in combat against his former friend. His descendants continued to hold on to the throne of the Western Empire despite many interruptions, yet now their authority extends no further than the city of Rome itself. Will the family of Valentinianus restore the Western Empire to its former extent? Or will their star rise ever higher and even unite the fractured Empire?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
verus;Blood of Verus;;;;;;;;;;;x
verus_desc;"Lucius Aurelius Verus Augustus became Roman co-Emperor in 161 CE, signaling the rise to proeminence of the Veri, who would go on to become one of the great Roman patrician Imperial families. His reign as co-Emperor began inauspiciously as Lucius Verus was forced to pay the Praetorian Guard a donative of 20,000 sestertii per capita in exchange for an oath of loyalty. His reign proceeded smoothly after this, and Lucius Verus became much loved by the people, as he lacked Imperial pomp and mingled with them freely. He instituted several programs aimed at taking care of poor children and integrating them from an early age within the military structure of the Empire. He allowed free speech, and was said to enjoy comedians who managed to mock him in intelligent fashion. Lucius Verus proved to be invincible on the battlefield, winning several battles for the Empire, in a quick efficient manner. In his later years, he turned to luxury, gambling and orgies, while still managing to fulfill his duties with great efficiency. He took the divinely beautiful Panthea as a mistress, whose influence over him was so great that comedians came to call him Panthea. The Emperor took this in good humor. Lucius Verus also became known as an avid collector of fossils and ""bones of giants"" and earned a reputation of a pleasure loving scholar, entertaining his guests with his knowledge and magnificent orgies. The other great Verus, Lucius Verus II was one of the greatest martial Emperors, sadly remembered by most only for his execution of the widow of Alexandros IV, Aquilia Severa. The Former Vestal virgin was buried alive according to Roman custom once Lucius took power. Her son Alexandros V would later forgive him, proclaiming it to have been ""the Roman way"". In 428 CE the magnate Quintus Verus was appointed hereditary military governor of Provincia, thus inaugurating the centuries long Veri rule over Provinica. The Veri remain one of the most prestigious and richest Roman aristocratic families, and provided they can sire a new Lucius, Imperial honors could once more be within their grasp!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vespasian;Blood of Vespasian;;;;;;;;;;;x
vespasian_desc;"Titus Flavius Caesar Vespasianus Augustus was Roman Emperor from 69 CE to 79 CE. With the support of the East behind him, Vespasian emerged victorious during the Year of the Four Emperors, after Alexandros II had been assassinated by his Nabatean mistress Salome. His son Titus, who would go on to become Emperor himself, subdued Judea, conquered Jerusalem and captured the Jewish fortress of Massada. In 73 CE Vespasian was responsible for the first wave of Jewish resettlement in the Sinai. The last words of the great Emperor, one last joke at the Divine Alexandros II's expense were: ""I think I am turning into a God."" The Vespasiani lost the Imperial throne, but managed to survive as one of the great Roman patrician families. The star of the Vespasiani rose once more in 895 CE as Leo VI the Macedonian appointed Lucius Vespasianus as hereditary Exarch of the restored Exarchate of Africa. The Vespasiani have remained in control of their African dominion ever since, still dreaming of their restoring their line to Imperial glory. Can the descendants of the Great Vespasian be Emperors once more? Only time will tell whether they can actually become Gods in Truth. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
viriathus;Blood of Viriathus;;;;;;;;;;;x
viriathus_desc;This character is a descendent of Viriathus, King of the Lusitani and first High King over Hispania. Valiant in dangers, prudent and careful in providing whatever was necessary, Viriathus was a man cut from the same cloth as the Homeric Heroes of old! When Punicus of Lusitania bowed to the Romans, one of the conditions was that the youngest soldiers, the flower of the Lusitanian military, be put to death. The order was carried out in 150 BCE, but one young soldier survived and the following year, he was king, and Punicusfs head decorated his spear. Viriathus moved fast, and in five years he unified the Lusitani, Celtiberi, and Iberian tribes into a single, unified force that fought Rome to a standstill at Numantia. \nFor centuries afterwards his line ruled Lusitania even as their hold over the rest of Hispania was broken by the Germanic tribes. The message of Mithras-Christ brought new fervor to their line, and it was a Viriathan, Martim Viriathus Vimaranes, who defeated the Caliph of Cordoba and prevented a Muslim conquest of Hispania. Now, with the blessing of Mithras Christ and the strength of the Lusitani, the line of Viriathus is poised to unite and free Hispania once again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
warcislaw;Blood of Warcislaw;;;;;;;;;;;x
warcislaw_desc;This character is a descendant of Lech, the oldest of three Slavic warlords from the 5th century CE. Leading a loose tribal confederation, Lech and his brothers Cech and Rus conquered the lands between the Dnieper and Elbe, forcing out or assimilating their former Gothic population. Soon after Lech had established his seat of power in Gniezno, the confederaton splintered, giving birth to three great Slavic peoples - the Polish, the Czechs and the Russians. Lech and his son Lech II led huge expeditions into German lands in 496, 512 and 518 CE, reaching as far as the Atlantic Ocean according to legend. In 578 CE Warcislaw of Pommerania conducted a devastating raid into Scandinavia, plundering Bornholm, southern Skane and Saeland in his wake. Even though the divided Slavs are now just a shade of their former strength, many warlords are likely to follow a strong, charismatic leader, should one appear. And who would be a better leader than a scion of Lech himself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wisimar;Blood of Wisimar;;;;;;;;;;;x
wisimar_desc;This character is a descendant of Wisimar, one of the great early High Kings of the Hasdingi Vandals. The blood of Wisimar provided many Vandal kings throughout history and continues to do so to this day. In 550 CE Gaiseric, a Vandal prince in control of territories on both sides of the Pillars of Hercules submitted to Belisarius and was confirmed as the first Vandal client King of Tingis. The powerful Vandal kingdom of Tingis proved to be an effective barrier against the expansion of Islam until 700 CE, when Godigisel II of Tingis assassinated his father and converted to Islam, in order to receive the support of Musa bin Nusair and his Islamic army. The Wisimarid Kings of Tingis were thus directly responsible for opening the door to the expansion of Islam into Hispania. Their control over the Pillars of Hercules and their powerful fleet means that the Wisimarids of Tingis are one of the greatest commercial powers of the Mediterranean if not the world. The blood of Wisimar hold the other Vandal princes in contempt, considering even the Kings of Carthage to be below them in their estimation. From their great stronghold of Tingis the Wisimarids plan to expand their dominion over the Mediterranean and beyond, for they know full well that their invincible fleet can bring them the glory they so richly deserve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

zenobia_desc;This character is a descendant of Zenobia, Warrior Queen of Palmyra. After her husband Odaenathus was assassinated in 267 CE, Zenobia took control as Queen of Palmyra as regent for her infant son Vaballathus, and expanded the Palmyran Empire by Egypt to the south in 269 CE and Ancyra in Asia Minor to the north in 272 CE, but these gains were lost to Roman emperor Alexandros V by 275 CE. By the peace treaty, she retained the title Empress of Palmyra, but renounced control of all territory outside Palmyra proper.\n\nWhile leading her troops, she displayed significant prowess. She was an able horse rider, and would march 3 or 4 miles with her soldiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aniketos;Blood of Aniketos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aniketos_desc;"This character is a descendant of the mighty line of Demetrius I Aniketos. In 184 BCE, Demetrius made the most of his position as the ruler of the furthest east of Alexander's old empire in Central Asia. After successfully invading large swathes of India, he used an amalgamation of Indohellenic aristocrats, Zhao bureaucrats, and Galatian soldiers to rule. However, his life was cut short by the traitorous Apollodotus I Soter before he could solidify his conquests. His sons split his empire, with Demetrius II taking India and Antimachus I taking Marakanda. When Demetrius II was assassinated by his general, Pusyamitra Sunga, his realm collapsed. Sunga would kill the usurper Apollodotus, but a coalition led by Antimachus and his younger brother, Menander, would eventually retake India. Menander cut ties with Marakanda after Antimachus was assassinated, and though he placed Antimachus's son on the throne of Marakanda thereafter, relations between the two sides of the family were never the same. The older line of the Aniketos once again found themselves limited to Marakanda. However, years later, the ambitious Alexandros II Aniketos saw an opportunity in the Peasant Rebellions against the Han, and set aside his rivalry with Menander's descendant, Epander II, to invade China from two directions. Alexandros made the legendary Katabasis to the Pacific in 96 BCE. He is said to have tearfully lamented that there were no worlds left to conquer, and instead sought to solidify his position in his new empire of Archeserika. Though the family has survived the centuries, the years have not been kind to the Aniketos family. Now, they are divided into a few small fiefdoms, but perhaps they could one day repeat the feats of their ancestors, or surpass them.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
epanderos;Blood of Epander;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
epanderos_desc;"This character hails from the line of Epander II and his grandfather, Menander I. The family's origins are murky, but they are believed to share a common ancestor with the Aniketos dynasty, and split from their cousins in 158 BCE when Menander, the new Megas Basileus of India, lost his ally and brother Antimachus in Marakanda. After that, Menander married a daughter of Apollodotus I, and his descendants would view themselves as separate from the Aniketos line in Marakanda. In 155 BCE, Menander invaded Lanka. After a successful conquest, Menander campaigned into China during the Rebellion of the Seven States, hammering the Han Dynasty and forcing them into a treaty of Eternal Frendship. His brother Alexandros was placed on the throne of the new satrapy of Antiocheia Eschate, based in Chengdu. Later, in 134 BCE, Epander I marched east, carving new provinces out of Burma and Nam Viet. His descendants would engage in a joint invasion of China with their distant Aniketos cousins. Meanwhile, the Megas Basileus's of India would campaign further south, conquering the Malay Peninsula and calling it Epandreia. This represenetd the apex of their power, and Epander III's navy perished in the Straits of Malacca before he could land in Sumatra. Since then, the family has been involved in some of the most brutal wars in Indian history, fighting both native kingdoms and Indohellenic rivals, and they are now a shadow of their former selves. Despite this, the Epanderos line still proudly claims the title of Megas Basileus of India, while other branches rule in far flung lands. Though hard times have befallen the descendants of Epander, they still remember their former power, and yearn to win back what they have lost.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
