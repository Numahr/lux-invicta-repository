# Regular Control Policy ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
centralization;Centralization;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
centralization_desc;The realm's centralization determines how much authority the ruler has in the affairs of its vassals as well as the maximum amount of levies and taxes. Centralizing the realm is a prerequisite for most reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
centralization_0;Decentralized;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
centralization_0_option;None;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
centralization_0_desc;The chaos of the past has caused such decentralisation on the administration of the realm that the only thing holding the realm together is distrust of outsiders and the chains of command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
centralization_1;Slightly Centralized;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
centralization_1_option;Minor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
centralization_1_desc;With the strengthening of administrative prerogatives, the mustering of men and money from vassals is slightly more efficient. The realm may now avoid splitting upon succession, although powerful vassals expect to exert significant influence on the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
centralization_2;Moderately Centralized;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
centralization_2_option;Moderate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
centralization_2_desc;With a moderate amount of control established, the overlord is now able to effectively muster men and money from its vassals. Legal administration of the realm becomes possible, paving the way for stable successions. The overlord can also exercise balanced sovereignty over landed titles, revoking them if necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
centralization_3;Highly Centralized;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
centralization_3_option;High;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
centralization_3_desc;At this level of control, the overlord now reserves the right to demand its vassal cease most of their wars against each other as well as forcing more men and money out of them. Succession may be arranged within the ruling dynasty independantly from the influence of powerful vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
centralization_4;Maximum Centralization;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
centralization_4_option;Max;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
centralization_4_desc;With this level of control, the overlord now enforces the sole right to war over its rightful vassals, as well as squeezing even more men and money from them. The overlord can impose absolute sovereignty over landed titles, revoking them at whim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Tribal Control Policy ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
clanic_centralization;Control on Clans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
clanic_centralization_desc;The level of control the overlord exercises on the realm's diverse clans and tribes determines how a new ruler is chosen, how much authority the overlord has on heads of clans and tribes and his ability to make centralized decisions for the realm. Less control also means the overlord should not control too large a demesne, but the realm can accommodate a larger number of autonomous chieftains.\n\nThe two main conditions to tightening control over tribes and clans are:\n- favorable disposition of one of the three influential classes: warriors, merchants or priests\n- personal leadership skills of the overlord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
clanic_centralization_0;Autonomous Clans and Tribes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
clanic_centralization_0_option;None;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
clanic_centralization_0_desc;The overlord has almost no authority on clans and tribes of the realm. Local chieftains think of themselves as almost independent rulers. They recognize their overlord only as a mere primus inter pares, to whom not much more is due than a vague and symbolic allegiance. They expect their overlord to retain a private demesne not larger than theirs. But as they benefit greatly from decentralized governance, they are ready to fight hard alongside their overlord against invaders threatening their tribal liberties.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
clanic_centralization_0_effect_1;Available succession law limited to §YElective Gavelkind§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
clanic_centralization_0_effect_2;If a non-tribal ruler declares war on the realm, the overlord will become §YDefenser of Tribal Liberties§!: tribes and clans will provide §Ymassive§! additional support for the duration of the war.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
clanic_centralization_1;Minor Control on Clans and Tribes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

clanic_centralization_1_option;Minor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
clanic_centralization_1_desc;Enjoying a limited level of authority, local chieftains may recognize as their obligations to pay a symbolic tribute and to send a few warriors to fight in their liege's wars. They expect their overlord to retain only a limited private demesne. But as they benefit from decentralized governance, they are ready to provide significant support to their overlord against invaders threatening their tribal liberties.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
clanic_centralization_1_effect_1;Available succession law limited to §YGavelkind§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
clanic_centralization_1_effect_2;If a non-tribal ruler declares war on the realm, the overlord will become §YDefenser of Tribal Liberties§!: tribes and clans will provide §Ysignificant§! additional support for the duration of the war.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

clanic_centralization_2_option;Moderate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
clanic_centralization_2_desc;With a moderate amount of control established, local chieftains recognize more discretionary power for their overlord, while still retaining a large autonomy. As they benefit from this relatively decentralized governance, they are ready to provide some support to their overlord against invaders threatening their tribal liberties.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
clanic_centralization_2_effect_1;Available succession law limited to §YGavelkind§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
clanic_centralization_2_effect_2;If a non-tribal ruler declares war on the realm, the overlord will become §YDefenser of Tribal Liberties§!: tribes and clans will provide §Ymarginal§! additional support for the duration of the war.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

clanic_centralization_3;Federation of Clans and Tribes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
clanic_centralization_3_option;Federal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
clanic_centralization_3_desc;At this level of control, clans and tribes recognize an institutionalized form of power beyond the immediate oath to their overlord, and they are willing to get actively involved in choosing their next liege. No ruler from outside the federation may legally inherit land controled by the federation. The overlord now reserves the right to demand clans and tribes to cease most of their internal feuding. They acknowledge their overlord's legitimate entitlement to rule directly a large private demesne.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
clanic_centralization_3_effect_1;Available succession laws include §YTanistry§! and §YGavelkind§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

clanic_centralization_4;Integrated Clans and Tribes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
clanic_centralization_4_desc;With this level of control, clans and tribes recognize that they belong to an institutionalized State, mirroring the power structure of the great Empires of old. The overlord is now able to demand the leaders of clans and tribes to give up their position, he can impose relatively stable succession laws and he may even create an imperial administration if he succeeds to rule over an empire. The overlord  enforces the sole right to engage war over all the realm's clans and tribes.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It also influences tribal merchants' financial contribution and the volume of taxes cities accept transferring to their overlord.
