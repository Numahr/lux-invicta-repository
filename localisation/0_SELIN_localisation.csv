adoptionist_DESC;Adoptionism is a Local Christian sect of Clerical soul, the remain of a once popular vision of Jesus Christ among newly-converted Jews in the Levant in the first century after the Incarnation of Christ. They believed that Jesus was the promised Messiah as it was foretold: a Prophet descendant of the Kings of Israel, nothing more, nothing less. Therefore, they rejected the divinity of Christ and his immaculate birth of the Virgin Mary, and considered such traditions as later additions and severe deviations from the Truth, very close to infraction of the First Commandment: "I am God your Lord, thou shalt worship no other god but me". This blend of Jewish orthodoxy and primordial Christianity was channeled through the Ebionites, the "Poor Ones", who declared Paul of Tarsus an apostate. In time, Theodotus of Byzantium proclaimed in the IInd Century that Jesus was a man entirely until God, because of his sinlessness and immaculate spirit, adopted him in order to make him Christ. This idea, an easy solution to the problem of monotheism in a religion with two main divinities (God and Christ) that are meant to be one and the same, kept reappearing in several places despite condemnation by all the Ecumenical Councils until it sprang with renewed force in Hispania in the VIIth Century, when the Archbishop of Toledo, Elipandus, and the Bishop of Urgell, Felix, propagated the view that the phrase "Son of God" was metaphorical, and that Christ was "adopted" by God after his baptism. At that moment, the human will of Christ became subservient to his new divine will. This christology was first adopted by a realm in Toledo after the great nobles assassinated their Catholic King Leogivild, who tried hard to convert them to catholicism. In the great Toledo council of 595, in the midst of anarchy, Hispania's nobles found a compromise solution between their various spiritual claims and to avoid entering in either Rome or Carthage's spheres of influence: they elected Leogivild's younger son Reccared, an Adoptionnist, with the Arian Euricing King of Leon famously proclaiming: "So called Catholic Monarchs have no place in Hispania." Adoptionism represented the least threatening of all faiths for the nobles' autonomy. Elipandus of Toledo, archbishop of Toledo (717-808) further codified Adoptionism by teaching that Christ's human nature existed separately from His divine personhood. The condemnation of this doctrine in the Council of Ratisbon in 792 only served to strengthen its hold on the Celtiberian highlands, where nobles remain jealous of their autonomy from distant Pope and Emperors. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aglibol_DESC;The worship of Aglibôl is a Local Archaic Canaanite religion of Messianic soul. The meaning, in Aramaic, is “Calf of Baal”. Aglibôl is depicted with a lunar halo decorating his head and sometimes his shoulders, and one of his attributes is the sickle moon. The worship of Aglibôl is traditionally strongly associated with Beelshamen’s. In the first century, the Palmyran religion focused increasingly on the trio constituted by the supreme god Beelshamên, the sun god Malakbêl and the lunar god Aglibôl. Aglibôl was worshipped due to his shadow providing refuge from the sun and his moisture making desert orchards bloom in the early morning. Aglibôl is said to wage a continuous war against his brother Malakbel, whereby their father Beelshamen, or Ba'al Samem, keeps on a neutral stance, thus the cycle of day and night. Then came the time of the glorious Palmyrene Empire in the 3rd Century. The Emperor Odaenathus and his wife Zenobia conquered Syria, the Parthian capital and Egypt, worshiping Beelshamen in an increasingly monotheist fashion as a reflection of their own absolute dominion of the lands of men. The new religious doctrine elevated Beelshamen as a rival of Sol Invictus, Ahura Mazda and Yahweh. In this evolving cult, the new Palmyrene State attempted to merge the personality of all lesser Gods, including Aglibôl, in the overwhelming figure of Beelshamen. Sacrifices to Aglibôl were forbidden. His statues and other representations were removed from the main temples. This only led to Aglibôl acquiring a new spiritual appeal. Discontent nobles and their high clerical allies, who perceived absolute monarchy and monotheism as threats to their influences, consciously adhered to the worship of Aglibôl as a shadow cult, secretly gathering opponents to the new regime. As the ephemeral Empire collapsed, the followers of Aglibôl acquired more freedom and developed their own cult further, maintaining a clout of occult mystery around it to better infiltrate the official Beelshameni clergy. Aglibôlis prophesize that the time will come when the Moon God will vanquish the arrogance of the other Gods, topple Beelshamen as Lord of the Heaven and reward those who worshipped Him during the long night of His occultation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ahriman_reformed_DESC;The Akomanic faith is a Reformed Mainstream Gnostic religion of Messianic soul, characterized by strong Persian influences. The reformed cult of the king of darkness, Ahriman. With the Manichean priesthood toppled, all the Ahrimanic cults have unified in to a single dualistic faith and now seek to expand the sacred darkness of their deity, who according to them, has existed since time immemorial. The wife-daughter of Ahriman, Aka Manah, is also worshipped as a spirit of love and sensuality. Many other formerly despised Daevas, like Jah, consort of Ahriman, is a spirit of fertility or, Aeshma who is now the spirit of bravery in battle. The ruler now is the head of the cult as the Ahrimanotema "He who is most like Ahriman", the top religious authority and the one who sanctions the rituals and sacrifices offered by the now organized priesthood to Ahriman. The masses of believers are eager to expand the teachings of the sacred darkness and lift the blinding oppression of the searing Light. If they succeed the priesthood promises a perfect new world brought to re-creation by Ahriman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alexandros_DESC;The cult of Alexandros-Ammon is a Local Greco-Roman religion of Martial soul, with significant Archaic influences. It centers around the worship of Alexandros III of Makedonia, also known as Megas Alexandros ('Alexander the Great'), who ruled Makedonia in 336-323 BCE. During the conquest of Aegyptus, Alexandros acquired a divine nature when he visited the Oracle of the Siwa Oasis, where he was proclaimed son of Zeus-Ammon, and 'Master of the Universe'. Henceforth, his cult grew with every following year, surviving even the dissolution of his empire in the wars of the Diadochi, and merging with the much more ancient worship of the Egyptian god Amun. His followers dream about the day when Alexandros-Ammon incarnate returns - this time to unify all the world under his leadership for all eternity. They commonly believe that re-enacting his legendary martial prowess in their current environment may draw his favor and accelerate his return: the religion incorporates much military training and ritual fighting, codified along strict and ancient rules.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
allat_DESC;The cult of Al-lat and her sisters is an Local Archaic Arabic religion of Traditional soul. A monolastic cult worshipping Al-lat, an Arabian goddess of light and life, as a primary deity, but it also honors Al-‘Uzzá, goddess of love and beauty and Manat, goddess of destiny and death, her two sisters. Believers think that by keeping the traditions of their Goddesses, they convince the three sisters to maintain the balance between life, fertility and death. The cult of Al-Lat belongs to an Archaic Civilization, spiritual heir of the first religions born in the cradle of empires - Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent. Its Doctrine is a Local variation of a mainstream religious current, favoring social harmony over doctrinal purity. Its Soul is Traditional: the faith follows the ancient traditions of the commoners and Local notables, and it has slowly evolved, if at all, throughout the recent era of troubles and turmoils.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
allfather_DESC;The worship of Wodanaz is a Local Germanic Barbarian religion of Traditional soul, characterized by strong Norse influences. Wodanaz ("Lord of Inspiration," also known as Wathonoz or Wotan) is the Germanic god of war and wisdom. He is a god of change, wind, and inspiration, master of ecstatic trance and patron god to travelers, shamans, and poets. Unlike Teiwaz, in war He represents the darker side of conflict, as exemplified by one of his titles “the lord of the Hall of the Slain”. He will gladly give his favor, and victory, to those that offer the lives of others in return. Very popular amongst Germanic nobility, many of their most famous chieftains and kings claim lineage from him. The Wodanazic branch of Germanic paganism rose during the chaos of the barbarian invasions in 355 AD, when the Germanic tribes started to come into direct contact with religious groups like the Christians or the Manicheans. Fearing that the traditions of their forefathers would soon be replaced by these foreign creeds, some of the most important Germanic chieftains and priests called for a meeting at Wimares. Under Wodanaz’s sacred oak, they swore to worship him as the sole god in the skies if this helped them keep their ancestral customs. Legends tell that, on that day, two ravens flew towards the sacred oak and rested on its branches. The priests took this as a sign of Wodanaz placing his favor on the kings and chieftains gathered there. From that day on, some Germanic tribes started to absorb other deities, both Local and foreign, into the figure of Wodanaz.  During the great Viking invasions of 800 AD, in encounters with their Scandinavian cousins,the Germanic tribesmen further syncretized Wodanaz with Odin, which gave him the aspects of Allfather and magical wanderer. The priesthood is decentralized, with emphasis being placed on the many “seers” and “sorcerers”, who claim to have been taught the magic arts by Wodanaz himself in his Hooded Wanderer guise. They preside over festivities as well as all sacrifices, animal or human, to Wodanaz. The totem animals of Wodanaz are the wolf and the raven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
almaqah_DESC;The worship of Almaqah is a Mainstream Archaic Arabic religion of Clerical soul. Almaqah is the great protector and sole patron god of the Sabaeans and especially of the Mukarribs, the unifier kings of Saba, so much that they even call themselves the children of Almaqah and claim direct descent from him. The greatest temple of Almaqah is the huge temple of Awâm near Ma'rib, the Sabaean capital. The temple is tended by his priesthood, who perform rites, bless newborns and receive the offerings that are to be placed on Almaqah’s shrine. A common offering to thank Almaqah usually consist on placing incense or little bronze figurines at his shrines to thank Him for past fortunes and to ask for more fortunes in the future. The rich often order their servants to make steles, statuettes or bronze plates adorned with many different animals, symbols and most importantly an inscription in which they thank Almaqah, the steles are later to be placed at the Local temples. However Almaqah is more than a protector god, he is also a god of fertility. He is the god of seasonal rain, and hence very important to the Sabaeans, as they pride themselves in their agricultural methods. Other aggressive natural phenomena, such as storms and thunders are associated to him as well, and not unlike Ba'al Hadad and other Near Eastern deities, have made his totem animal the bull, though more often, in his shrines one can find depictions of ibexes and mountain goats which are as well associated with the father of the Sabaeans . When Southwestern Arabia was unified by the Mukarrib kings of Saba, they ordered the temples and statues dedicated to other gods, such as ‘Attar, Ta-lab or Shams, to be destroyed and replaced by shrines and temples dedicated to Almaqah, establishing their supremacy as unifier kings of the new Sabaean federation. Since then, the glory of Almaqah has made the Sabaeans into a thriving metropolitan culture, and His protective influence has been able to withstand and even turn back the might of Islam during its climax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amanai_DESC; The worship of Amanaii is an Local Saharan religion of Martial soul, with a strong Greco-Roman influences. Amanaii is Berber god of the setting sun, and Megas Alexandros is often identified by the Berbers as Amanaii made flesh. The cult of Amanai belongs to a Barbarian Civilization, characterized by an emphasis on rural areas, individual martial prowess, and low division of labor. Its Doctrine is a Local variation of a mainstream religious current, favoring social harmony over doctrinal purity. Its Soul is Martial: heroic deeds on the battlefield are glorified as the finest sign of holiness. It also has a Greco-Roman Ascendant, characterized by a strong interest in civic matters and well-organized military.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amun_DESC;The cult of Amun is a Reformed Mainstream Archaic Egyptian religion of Statist Soul. The faith focuses on Amun-Ra as the king of the gods of Egypt. The faith is a polytheistic faith, and while Amun-Ra is considered the king of the gods, the other Egyptian deities are also worshipped. Some of the more popular deities are Hathor, Isis, Osiris, Set, Bast, Ra, and Horus. In daily life most of the rituals revolve around the Nile River, it is common for many farmers to provide offerings to Osiris for a good harvest. The calendar is arranged according to the Nile River. One of the central things of the Amunite faith is the relation between the living and the dead. Death festivals are common, but the dead are considered to be in a happy blessed land and can come and visit the living from time to time and effect their descendants for good or ill. Thus, the ancestors or Akhu are given offerings just like the gods are. A final central tenet is Ma'at or harmony with the world, everyone from the lowest of peasants to the King himself are to uphold Ma'at. It is believed that if the king himself goes against this then this will bring disorder and ruin upon the kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amun_reformed_DESC;The Kemetic faith is a Reformed Mainstream Archaic Egyptian religion of Statist soul. It's name comes from the Egyptian word Kemet, which means "black soil", referring to the Nile's banks and thus, to Egypt. It claims to be the same faith that the ancient Egyptians practiced. Like their ancestors they worship a variety of deities including Aset, Wesir, Baset, Herthet, Heru, Yinepu, and many others. Similarly the Nile provides a strong focus for the faith, religious festivals as well as the harvest are all governed by the calendar that is based on the flooding of the Nile. The head of the religion is the Nisut-Bity, he of sedge and bee, this position though is granted to the ruling dynasty of Egypt and thus the ruler of Egypt is the head of the Kemetic faith. As in the past, the dead play a highly important role in the Kemetic faith. Death festivals are common, honoring and venerating the ancestors or Akhu as they are called is one of the important aspects of the faith. Another central tenet is the upholding of Ma'at or harmony and justice with the world. Everyone is to follow it from the Pharaoh himself down to the lowliest of peasants. They believe that if you do not follow Ma'at then you can doom yourself to being judged to being eaten by Ammet in the afterlife, furthermore they also believe that if the king is not upholding Ma'at then it will bring ruination to the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
anansi_DESC;The worship of Anansi is a Local West African Shamanic religion of Martial soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
antinomian_DESC;Antinomianism is an Heretical Christian sect of Populist soul, characterized by strong Barbarian influences. It emerged in the 1st Century as a result of theological criticisms over the strict morale rules contained in the Old Covenant. According to some, moral law was of no use or obligation under the gospel dispensation of grace because faith alone was necessary to salvation. Under this theological guidance, some early Christian communities in Jerusalem are said to have practiced anarchist communism, sharing money, labor and women equally and fairly among the members, refusing any set of rules that they considered arbitrary. These early experiments, remembered by marginalized priests exiled to the fringes of Christianity, spurred a renewal among superficially-Christianized Goths when imperial authority weakened. In the ensuing chaos, new ambitious leaders looking for a mobilizing ideology met the radical preachers of the Antinomian revolution. The new Antinomian rulers claimed that Jesus' love, which is limitless, would wash away the sinful laws and hierarchies set up by the former Roman elite. Antinomianism is now a political and economic program as much as a religion, whereby believers combine Gothic tribal rituals with a new emphasis on moral nihilism, sexual freedom, and absolute collectivism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apollinarist_DESC;Apollinarism is a Local Christian creed of Clerical soul. Apollinarists follow the teachings of Apollinaris of Laodicea, a bishop in Syria during the 4th Century. The main principle is that Jesus could not have had a human mind, but rather a human body and a divine mind. This goes against the traditional view that Jesus had both a human body and mind, as culminated by his presence as the Son of God made flesh. Apollinarism was declared to be a heresy in 381 CE  by the First Council of Constantinople. Since Christ was officially depicted as fully human and fully God, followers of Apollinarianism were accused of attempting to create a tertium quid ("third thing"), neither God nor man. Apollinarius was a prolific writer and a charismatic missionary, and some clerics still follow his teachings, differentiating themselves from the mainstream Christian theology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
arab_pagan_reformed_DESC;The Abeed al-Shams (Followers of the Sun) are a Reformed Mainstream Archaic Arabic faith of Statist soul. A formal union of all the pantheistic beliefs in the Arabian peninsula controlled by a newly formed priesthood and the ruler claiming descent from Hubal himself. The main god of this pantheon is Hubal, the chief of the gods. Hubal has three daughters:  Al-lat  (goddess  of  the  underworld),  Al-Uzza  (“The Mighty One”, goddess of fertility), and Manat (goddess of fate). Manat especially was venerated, and many sacrifices (including children) were made in her honor. The Kaaba in Mecca is now decorated with idols to all the gods recognized by the newly formed ash-Shamsi priesthood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
arian_DESC;Arianism is a Mainstream Christian denomination of Statist soul. A Christian church founded by Presbyter Arius, emphasizing on the belief that Christ did not always exist, but as created by God, and is therefore separate from him. There is a strong belief in the disunity of the Trinity, and the supremacy of God over Jesus and the Holy Spirit.It became very popular amongst Germanic converts. Arian rulers use the rhetoric of Arius, specifically the supremacy of God amongst the other aspects of the Trinity to haver higher degree of control in the affairs of the church. Arianism belongs to the Christian Civilization, characterized by a focus on strong rural fortified holdings and special privileges to the clergy. Its Doctrine is Mainstream: it is recognized as one of the main doctrinal systems in its most legitimate form. Its Soul is Statist: the faith is strongly infused with legitimation rethorics supporting political power, as the religion is instrumentalized by the Prince to strengthen its hold on society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ashari_DESC;The Ash'ari are a Islamic Local school of Clerical Soul. It belongs to the Islamic Civilization, characterized by efficient tax systems and great cities but dynastic distrust.

aten_DESC;The cult of Aten is an Heretical Archaic Egyptian faith of Martial soul. The faith is monotheistic focusing the worship on the god Aten, the Solar Disk. It grew out of secret cults that stayed true to the religious reforms that Pharaoh Akhenaten started. In daily life they tend to focus on hymns to the Sun Disk Aten. Unlike other Egyptian faiths they do not practice offerings. They sing praises to Aten, but he does not require any offerings from humans.  They have a strong warrior and community ethic as they had to band together to avoid persecution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aten_reformed_DESC;The Armanist faith is a Reformed Mainstream Archaic Egyptian religion of Statist soul. Amarnism is the reformed version of Aten's cult and thus it retains many of the traits of the Atenist faith, particularly the focus on singing hymns. The ruler of the State is considered living incarnation of Aten, and thus there's a strong focus on honoring that position. The name Amarnist comes from Amarna the site of the ancient city where Akhenaten first worshipped Aten. Akhenaten is considered the first prophet of the faith and is thus held in high regard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
athari_DESC;The Athari are a Islamic Local school of Clerical Soul. It belongs to the Islamic Civilization, characterized by efficient tax systems and great cities but dynastic distrust.

attar_DESC;The worship of ‘Attar is a Local Archaic Arabic religion of Martial soul. ‘Attar is a divinity of the south Arabian pantheon, and is their original god of thunderstorms and rain. ‘Attar is the "God of Thunder" and is often known by the epithet “Shariqan”, or "the Eastern god" after the morning position of the planet Venus: he is a vengeful god as well, who is invoked against the desecrators of graves. He exercises a double function: he is both a dispenser of fertility and a patron of war. The main rite to honor him is the ritual gazelle hunt. 'Attari rulers conduct these ritual hunts mainly for the purpose of obtaining rain, which explain why the gazelle is ‘Attar’s animal attribute. Before the unification of southern Arabia by the Mukarribs (Unifier Kings) of Saba, he used to be the main god of the Local pantheon, above all the Local tribes’ patron gods, and was often invoked to preside in deals between them. During the Sabaean unification, the Almaqahi Mukarribs displaced him as the main god, in some cases, forcibly destroying his temples, sacred sites and killing ‘Attar’s priests, in order to establish the supremacy of Saba and its protector, Almaqah. The Almaqahi priesthood demonized ‘Attar as a savage and uncivilized god, whose unpredictable rain made Sabaean agriculture impossible to prosper, as opposed to Almaqah, the patron of artificial irrigation. Some of ‘Attar’s most fervent followers choose to sail away to the south, to Ethiopia, rather than submit to the Sabaeans. There, the cult of ‘Attar suffered a transformation: to prevent massacres like those perpetrated by the Sabaeans, now every priest would have to master the use of the spear, ‘Attar’s sacred weapon, upon acceptance into the priesthood, and ‘Attar’s war god aspect would be emphasized over his agricultural side. Now, ‘Attar’s reformed martial priesthood, unbent and unbroken, are poised to reclaim southern Arabia in a storm of war and sand, for the glory of ‘Attar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
audianist_DESC;Audianism is a Local Christian creed of Traditional soul. Audaeus was a theologian living in 4th Century Syria. In 325 CE at the First Council of Nicaea, he led the opposition to the official Church when it was decreed that all Christians should follow the Roman tradition of celebrating Pascha (Easter) at the Easter Sunday, and no longer at the date of 14 Nisan, like the Jewish Passover. The Audians complained that the church had "abandoned the fathers' Paschal rite in Constantine's time from deference to the emperor, and changed the day to suit the emperor." Audianist communities were later the target of sporadic persecutions, until Imperial authorities proposed to re-locate them North of the Black Sea where they would enjoy tolerance of their cult and act as a vanguard of the Imperial civilization. Since then, Audianists cling to their unique tradition, composed of outdated Christian rituals and nostalgia for the Syrian homeland they left centuries ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

beelshamen_DESC;The worship of Beelshamen is a Mainstream Archaic Canaanite religion of Statist soul. The antiquity of the worship of the god or gods of Baal extends back to the Bronze Age among the ancient Semitic peoples. The word Baal means "master" or "owner": Baal was once common a name of small Syrian and Persian deities. The Great Baal is the Canaanite god of storm and heavens, worshipped primarily in Palmyra and antique Carthage. In the first century, the Palmyran religion focused increasingly on the trio constituted by the supreme god Beelshamên, the lunar god Aglibôl, and the sun god Malakbêl. Beelshamên leads the triad: as the lord of heaven, he commands both the moon and the sun. Beelshamen was thus fervently prayed to for the protection of livestock and crops, as he is responsible for sun and rain, as well as droughts, plagues, and other calamities. The ancient religion acquired a new dimension in the 3rd Century as strong monotheist trends coalesced in the cult of Beelshamen during the glorious times of the short-lived Palmyrene Empire. In 260, with the Roman Empire in crisis, Odaenathus and his wife Zenobia, rulers of Palmyra, carved a vast Middle Eastern empire through a series of rapid and successful campaigns and ambitious foreign policies, conquering Syria, the Persian capital Ctesiphon and Egypt. As part of their empire-building efforts, they developed religious pride among their subjects by controlling the clergy and equating Beelshamen with Roman Sol Invictus and Persian Ahura Mazda. Beelshamen’s attributes, the eagle and the lightning bolt, became the symbols of the new State as expression of unchallenged authority wherever Palmyrene arms imposed its dominion. Both sovereigns made an explicit parallel between their exceptional deeds and Beelshamen’s supremacy among other, lesser Gods, claiming supremacy over lands worshipping other Canaanite or Phoenician deities. While the old Palmyrene Empire failed in its ambitious dream of gathering all Eastern cults into one, the memory of its glory is alive. The cult of Beelshamen retains a strong mystical aura in the lands once Palmyran and beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
berber_pagan_DESC;The Amazigh faith is a Local Saharan religion of Traditional soul. It is the traditional faith of the Berber people, whose main gods include Mastiman (analogue to Greek Zeus), Amanai (analogue to Egyptian Amun) and Gurzil (analogue to Roman Mars).

bogomilist_DESC;Bogomilism is a Local Gnostic religio-political sect of Populist soul. It arose in Macedonia as a political movement in opposition to the social stratification brought by the Roman social structures and the official church. The Bogomils derive their name from their founder, the priest Bogomil (Theophilus) and the teachings of the Paulicans, a group of Manichaeans that settled in Thrace in the late 8th Century. Because grace could not bind itself to matter, Bogomils believe that Christ had only the semblance of a human body, and they reject the Eucharist and other sacraments, as well as relics and the use of material items in worship. Bogomils explain the earthly sinful corporeal life as a creation of Satan, an angel that was sent to Earth. Because of that, Bogomils are ascetic and tend to reject marriage, the eating of animal products, and anything created with materialistic or worldly goals in mind. Followers are called to refuse paying taxes, working in serfdom, or fighting for anything except the expansion of their faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

bud_pureland_DESC;Buddhaksetra ("Buddha Field"), also known as the Pure Land Buddhism, is a Local Buddhist religion of Messianic soul, with significant Hellenistic influences. It emerged in early 5th century among the Sogdian and Greek inhabitants of Serindia from proselytic, messianic Buddhism spread in Central Asia by Sogdian merchants, where it adapted partly to the dominant Hellenic elite. Its adherents venerate Amitabha, the Buddha of Compassion, who promised that those who heed his call will be reincarnated in the land of Sukhavati, also known as the Pure Land or the Elysian Fields. There he will instruct them in ways of achieving Nirvana, along with his subordinate gods and bodhisattvas: Vajrapani-Hercules, Apollo-Mahasthamaprapta and Kanishka Alexandros. Devotional practices of Buddhaksetran Buddhists include meditation, sutra chanting, purification and offerings of wine, food and plants, all meant to bring the practitioner closer to the Compassionate Buddha and gain favor of his gods. These actions are meaningless, however, if one does not actively seek to expand the light of Amitabha's teachings in this world. It is therefore seen as a sacred duty for the Pure Land Buddhists, and especially for their rulers, to bring salvation to humanity by enlightening infidels and expanding the earthly dominion of Buddhaksetra to the end of the known world. A Buddhaksetran realm is considered as a gateway to Sukhavati, a Buddha Field on Earth where everybody can earn their salvation by pious practices taught by monks, and the best Buddhaksetran rulers are considered bodhisattvas or gods incarnate and venerated after their death and ascension.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

cathar_DESC;Catharism is an Heretical Christian movement of Populist soul, characterized by strong Gnostic influences. It developed in response to growing corruption in the Catholic Church. It has a strong influence from Manichaeism and early gnostic religions, and maintains close connections with the similar Bogomilist movement in the east. The Cathars are a direct challenge to the Catholic Church, renouncing Catholic practices and dismissing it outright as the Church of Satan. Rather than traditional sacraments, Catharism has only one sacrament: the Consolamentum, in which a brief ceremony is performed to remove all sin from the believer, or credentus, thus making them a perfectus. This sacrament must only be performed once, but perfecti must maintain a strong obligation of purity (and thus, many Cathars perform the Consolamentum on their death-bed). Purity in this life is attained through asceticism and strict moral rules. Sexual actions, even when sanctified by marriage, are abhorred on the grounds that the material world - including the flesh - is intrinsically evil, and thus Cathars largely reject the concept of marriage.  The Cathar society and church have a relatively flat structure, organized around bishops sharing the ascetic principles of their fellow believers and promoting the share of goods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cathar_reformed_DESC;Consolamentian is a Reformed Heretical Christian movement of Populist soul, characterized by strong Gnostic influences. With the corrupted Christian priesthood toppled, the Cathars have reformed and codified their rites and faith.

The ruler uses his influence within this group who in turn instruct the masses in the teachings of the new Consolamentian faith to expand their message of equality across the world. Even now that the more revolutionary elements have been eliminated, Some radical priest still speak out against the rulers or incite the masses to wage holy war against the enemies of Consolamentianism, those possessed by the evils of the material world and Satan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
catholic_DESC;Catholicism is a Mainstream Christian religion of Clerical soul. Catholics worship the prophet Jesus of Nazareth who sacrificed himself to redeem humankind from its sins, under the interpretation of the Church established by his follower Peter. Jesus Christ is believed to be of both divine and humane nature, son of God, Maria and the Holy Spirit. The Church has a very complex clergy system, headed by a single person known as the Pope. Under the Pope is the College of Cardinals, which consists of priests and other clergy appointed by the Pope. The Pope is elected from amongst the College of Cardinals when the former Pope dies. Catholicism consists of many tenets of faith, including purgatory, Christian sacraments, and the Pope's position as the divine spokesman for God on Earth. Rulers and clergy often butt heads over power, sometimes resulting in wars between the Papacy and other Christian realms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
celtic_christ_DESC;Hibernicism is a Local Celtic religion of Traditional soul, characterized by strong Christian influences. Christianity arrived in Britain with the Roman legions in the 4th Century, but as the Roman presence remained unstable, Local clerics reinterprated Christianity in a fashion more in line with their own Celtic traditions, creating a new variant of Christianity commonly called called Hibernicism. Old Celtic traditions kept alive by Druidism slowly became more and more intertwined, and as a result, Hibernicism developed into an ever-changing, peculiar synthesis between its fading Christian background and the revived Celtic belief system. In particular, characters of the Christian Saints and Celtic heroes influence each other, to the extent that the historical figure of Jesus of Nazareth is sometimes merged into one of the most prominent characters of the Celtic sagas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
celtic_christ_reformed_DESC;Cuchulainnism is a Reformed Mainstream Celtic religion characterized by a Statist soul, characterized by strong Christian Influences, the result of a recent religious reform. The Hibernicist Christians, under the influence of monks keeping alive Celtic paganism in their heart and soul, had been for centuries associating characters from Christian scriptures and tradition with Celtic heroes of old, to the extent that the historical figure of Jesus of Nazareth was sometimes merged with one of the most prominent characters of the Celtic sagas. This made possible for a great leader, shattering the world by resonating victories, to proclaim himself the heir of Cú Chulainn the Savior, the greatest of Celtic demi-Gods, now fully merged with the character of he whom mainstream Christians call Jesus of Nazareth. In the newly codified Gospels of Brendan and Patrick, Hibernicist bishops developed a complex narrative where the Celtic elements dominate but incorporate more traditional Christology in order to give birth to the narrative frame for a new era. Cú Chulainn, Sétanta the Redeemer, Christ Messiah, was born of Lugh, God Allmighty, Father of All, and Mary-Danu, said to be one of the three aspects of Morrigan, the Great Queen. God Allmighty had sent Cú Chulainn to guide the promised people and bring forth justice, but he was betrayed by his unfaithful companions, Lugaid, son of Cú Roí and Erc, son of Cairbre Nia Fer, who abandoned him in the last, decisive battle against the Romans led by Brutus and Pilatus. Imprisoned, tortured and crucified on a great stone now object of a holy worship, Cú Chulainn promised his return to right all the wrongs, bring justice to the world and redeem his true followers. And now, the Messiah that Cú Chulainn announced returns and marks the dawn of a new era, where all forces must obey their Guide and enter the Otherworld upon their earthly death. The new Cuchulainnist Faith thus provides a strong spiritual legitimacy and the support of a highly organized priesthood, renewing the mystical aura of the Druidic tradition within a clerical structure not unlike Rome’s Church, fully devoted to its Supreme Guide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
celtic_pagan_DESC;The Druidic faith is the Celtic Mainstream religion, characterized by a Traditional Soul. Followers worship various tribal deities, including some of the more pan-tribal deities such as Teutatis, Taranis, Lugh, Nuada, Brighid, in a fashion which has not changed much since the early Iron Age. In addition to these deities, they also place an emphasis on their ancestors and Local nature spirits, often associated with stones, trees and bodies of water. Special connection to nature in Celtic Pagans' religion is also illustrated by the importance of sacred oaks and the usage of mistletoe as sacred medicine. In social life, the most important feature of the religion is the central role played by its clergy, the Druids, in maintaining religious and social cohesion. They are responsible for organizing worship and sacrifices, divination and judicial procedure. They preside over complex rituals revolving around sacred banqueting and bull-sacrificing, following a calendar based on moon cycles. Although Druids prefer keeping away from the sphere of politics and abhor putting any sacred lore in writing, or maybe because of that, their spiritual aura goes much beyond those following the Celtic traditional religion and is widely respected, even by worshippers of other cults. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
celtic_pagan_reformed_DESC;The worship of the Tuatha Dé ("Tribe of the Gods") is a Reformed Mainstream Celtic faith, characterized by a Statist soul and archaic tendencies, the result of a recent religious reform. By engaging in a voyage worthy of Cú Chulainn himself, coming back from Tír na mBeo and re-uniting sacred artefacts left by the Gods in this world’s most holy places, a great leader has made possible for the Celtic faith to renew the glory of older times. Followers are known as Tuatha Dé, “People of the Gods”, for they now equal the holiness of long forgotten forbears who used to mingle with the Gods themselves. Provided with guidance and leadership, the Druids have found a renewed role as servants of the new order. Their caste has lost nothing of its prestige and keeps the core traditions alive: they remain guardians of the Oak Tree, perform animal sacrifices, preside over sacred banquets and continue to give justice. But they now use sacred Ogham to administrate, codify sacred lore and propagate the realm of the People of the Gods, in service to their new Archdruid, the elected ruler of their caste, and their King as well, the One who Travels to the Otherworld. Like the trumpets and the horns of war blown to expel the Roman invaders and the Briton oppressors under the tyrant Arthur, like the wrath of the Divine Queen Brigid and Nuada the Strong fighting against the Fomorians, like Bran traveling across the Great Ocean in search of the Tír na nÓg and its Fountain of Knowledge, now the world is aghast by the new wonders that herald a new age of heroes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

cybele_DESC;The cult of Cybele is a Local Greco-Roman faith of Clerical soul. The faith is a henotheistic faith that is a legacy from the antique Phrygians, dwellers of Western Anatolia in the Bronze Age, who worshipped “Matar Kubileya”, the Mother Goddess. Greek settlers arriving in Asia Minor in the beginning of the Iron Age adopted the Phrygian cult, centering their worship on Cybele, the Earth Mother, an exemplar of devoted motherhood, the Mistress of Animals, ever accompanied by lions that flank her, sit in her lap and draw her chariot. From the shores of Asia Minor the cult spread westwards and met considerable success, as Cybele was equated with other Greek deities such as Demeter and Gaïa. In spite of her popularity, Cybele remained controversial and was perceived as an ambiguous symbol of exotic foreignness among Western Greeks, to the extent that the spread of cult was accompanied by violent debates and even conflicts. Many kings in Asia Minor, in particular Eumenes I of Pergamum, saw the political opportunity of supporting a cult distinguishing a strong local identity against other Hellenistic realms and adopted Cybele as their protectors. As the rise of Rome provoked the political and cultural integration of Asian Minor realms in the global Empire, the worship of Cybele evolved from being a State religion sponsored by ambitious petty Kings to becoming a more occult mystery cult, still strongly associated with Anatolian identity. Deprived of political sponsorship, the cult now strived on the appeal of its esoteric rites involving ecstatic music, dancing and self-castration as a sign of devotion to the Goddess. Those individuals initiated to the higher degrees of the Cybelite cult hold considerable influence in their society. Thus the cult constitutes a highly structured hierarchy, informal and decentralized, but that works in parallel to the mundane social and political structures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dionysos_DESC;The cult of Dionysus is an Heretical Greco-Roman cult of Populist soul. Dionysus is the Greek god of the grape harvest, winemaking and wine, of ritual madness and religious ecstasy, in dichotomy with Apollo. Both Apollo and Dionysus are sons of Zeus: Apollo is the god of reason and the rational, while Dionysus is the god of the irrational and chaos. This philosophical dichotomy gradually developed a social dimension. As the elite, intent on keeping potentially dangerous natural instincts in check, excluded Dionysus from the Olympian Pantheon, marginalized cities or social groups, such as foreigners and slaves, reverted to its worship as a culture of resistance. Therefore a mystery cult developed, initially limited to the lower strata of society. Initiates of the Dionysian cult use intoxicants and other trance-inducing techniques, like dance and music, to remove inhibitions and social constraints, liberating the individual to return to a natural state. In the Imperial age, the Dionysian mystery cult grew in influence, merging with the Latin cult of Bacchus and worship of the Fertility Goddess Liber, as its transgressive sensuality combined with a vague promise for a radical renewal attracted increasing proportion of the idle elite. With the descent into chaos of the empire, the Dionysian cult has only gained momentum as a potential new foundation for society, cleansing all from evil through an ecstatic return to the source of being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
docetist_DESC;Docetism is a Local Christian faith of Scholarly soul. It derivates from an unorthodox interpretation concerning the meaning, figurative or literal, of a sentence from the Gospel of John: "the Word was made Flesh", under the influence of heterodox Judaism and ancient Oriental and Greek philosophies. Docestists believe that the phenomenon of Christ, his historical and bodily existence, and thus above all the human form of Jesus, was altogether mere semblance without any true reality. Jesus only appeared to be human, while in actuality he was a phantasmal projection from Heaven. While Docetism was unequivocally rejected at the First Council of Nicaea in 325 CE, it remained alive among the learned of Eastern Anatolia, eventually becoming a popular creed among Armenian communities and rulers. Docetists emphasize skeptical interpretation of the mainstream Christian theology and seeking hidden truths concealed behind appearances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
donatist_DESC;Donatism is an Heretical Christian creed of Traditional soul, with a strong Berber ascendant. Donatus Magnus was a bishop in Carthage in the early 4th Century. He challenged the authority of the clergy appointed by the official Catholic hierarchy, on the ground that these clerics had surrendered their faith during times of persecution. After his death in exile around 355 CE, the parallel clergy put in place by Donatists increased its influence among Berber rural populations refusing the rule of Rome and of the official Catholic Church. The Circumcellions were bands of nomadic anti-Roman rebels and Punic-speaking bandits from the lower strata of society who supported Donatism and were sometimes led by Donatist clergy. Over the centuries, Donatism has flourished and evolved as a syncretic religion with nationalist elements, incorporating traditional Amazigh elements into Christianity and violently opposing the strict clerical and social hierarchy of the more-established Christian denominations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

endovellico_DESC;The cult of Endovellico-Neto is a Local Celtic faith with a martial soul and strong Greco-Roman influences. Endovelicus was an Iron Age god of public health and safety, worshipped among other gods in pre-Roman Lusitania and Gallaecia, associated with chthonic oracles and healing. After his defeat at the hands of the Romans, Punicus, the King of the Lusitani, decided to consolidate his new position as a Roman client-King by focusing public worship on this Deity, emphasizing its syncretic Greco-Roman identity to get himself and his people better accepted in the new Roman order. The nature of Endovelicus then evolved with the fortune of the Lusitani and geopoliticsm. As plenty of Lusitanian soldierly began to flock into Roman military as legionnaires or auxiliaries, Endovellicus was conflated with the god Neto, patron of the nearby Arevaci, who was by then syncretized into Mars Neto, sun god of warriors and defender of the land. Thus, at the height of the Pax Romana, there was only a single Lusitanian Sun God with two faces, Endovellicus-Neto. To his worshippers, he is the Healing Sun, the protective and caring father of the Lusitan people, to their enemies he is the Scorching Sun, the harsh and passionate protector of the Lusitanian homeland. Other Lusitanian deities from their Celtic origins, such as Ataecina, of rebirth and the spring season, or Nabia, of rivers and waters were made into Local protector spirits, subservient to Endovellicus-Neto. With the descent of Iberia into chaos, Endovelicus-Neto increasingly became a reference for the proud and tough Lusitani armies protecting their homeland against waves of invaders. He is mostly worshipped now as an invincible protector, the lord of the scorching ray, the God who gave strength to the arm of the great Lusitanian, King Martim Viriathus, with which he could vanquish the Caliph of Cordoba in 929 at the Battle of Evora.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Other deities include Akka (goddess of fertility and wife of Ukko), Ahti (the sea god), Tapio the forest god), Nyyrikki (the god of the hunt), and so forth. There is no holy text for Suomenusko, but the epic folk tale of Finland (the Kalevala) is regarded as a source of information on the beliefs of the Suomenusko adherents. Many rituals common in other ethnoreligions, including sacrifice, bonfires, sacred groves, drinking toasts to the gods, and wooden idols are all elements of Suomenusko.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish_pagan_reformed_DESC;The Kalevalan faith is a Reformed Mainstream Finnic Shamanic religion of Statist soul. The transfer of oral Finnish tradition to a written form has imbued the Finnish pagans with not only a sense of unity but also given the faith more structure. Shamans from all corners of the faith have come together to support this written Kalevala and to banish the foreigners from Finnish lands. Forever shall the land of Kaleva remain unblemished!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fraticelli_DESC;The Fraticelli (Italian for "little brothers") are a Local Christian sect of Populist soul that formed in response to corruption in the Catholic Church. Their main opposition is to materialistic wealthiness exhibited by so-called Christians, going so far to say that a clergyman with wealth should have his clerical status nulled. A strong emphasis on poverty is capitalized in this sect, to the extent that private property baring the strict minimum is considered as wealth. Fraticelli apply this principle to individuals as well as to the church, and their ultimate goal is to clean the corrupt church and other devious creeds of their unholy devotion to wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
german_pagan_DESC;The Furistaz Siduz ( "Foremost Custom" ) is a Mainstream Germanic Barbarian faith of Traditional soul. It refers to the polytheistic religious traditions of the continental Germanic peoples. While Germanic and Norse paganism share many similarities, the cultures, names, and practices are different, thus, to say Forn Sidr and Furistaz Siduz are the same religion would be inaccurate. Main gods include Wodanaz the Allfather, Teiwaz the god of war and fair rule, Thunraz the thunder god and Frijjo, wife of Wodanaz and goddess of fertility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
german_pagan_reformed_DESC;The Niwjaz Siduz ( "The New Custom" ) is a Reformed Mainstream Germanic Barbarian religion of Statist soul. Despite its unyielding behavior through history, even the greatest of traditions must change someday. The "foremost custom" of Germanic paganism has improved upon itself.

graeco_roman_DESC;The Classical Hellenic religion is a mainstream Greco-Roman faith of traditional soul. Followers worship a vast pantheon, the most important of which are the Dodekatheon, i.e. the twelve Olympian Gods including Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Aphrodite, Hephaestus, Hermes and either Hestia or Dionysus, depending on Local variations. Most towns and neighborhoods of larger cities have their own favored deities or mythical semi-Gods, generally closely intertwined to the site’s mythic origin as well as forbears to its most noble and prominent families. The religion is very demonstrative and regulates social life through rites and a well-defined calendar of events. Ritual offerings are practiced at levels, from household shrines to the largest temple, constitute one of the central practices in the religion in daily life. In particular, the religion is quite unique for its prevalence of household shrines, where most believers pray and leave offerings, with the foremost household deity being Hestia, who receives an offering at the beginning and ending of the rituals. In public, priests lead public and communal rituals that provide offerings to the gods. This clergy, although it enjoys much respect, remains much decentralized and even temples worshipping the same deity are often independent from one another. In spite of this organizational weakness, the strength of this religion lies in the extremely strong bound it creates within societies that still follow it, with a mystical relationship to their history, natural and architectural environments. This may explain how the religion has gone through the centuries of imperial power, especially in smaller Islands, creeks and other havens of an old Mediterranean world that Ulysses would not find too unfamiliar. That religion retains a strong spiritual appeal to many, in association with the antique simplicity of a world where the Gods still live close by the Mortals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
graeco_roman_reformed_DESC;The Olympist religion is a Mainstream Greco-Roman faith with a Statist soul and Archaic ascendency. It is an evolution of the Greco-Roman faith, and thus the main beliefs are the same. They worship a vast pantheon of gods, with the name Olympist coming from the main set of deities that they worship, the Olympians, but they do worship other deities including Nymphs and Local Nature spirits, as well as a collection of Heroes and Heroines, with one of the most widely worshipped Heroes being Herakles. In Daily life, people provide numerous offerings from wine to animal sacrifices to the numerous beings that they worship. A prayer is, in general, not thought to be complete if one does not at least offer a libation. The religion is an organized religion, with kings supporting the church, and the church supporting the kings. There is an organized priesthood for the deities, with a Hierophant at it's head, but the priesthood values its independence which it has held since time immemorial.Thus, while it has become more organized, many regions still have Local differences, with Local gods or heroes given precedence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

iconoclast_DESC;The Iconoclasts are an Heretical Christian sect of Clerical soul, with significant Islamic influences. During the 8th Century, Islam was becoming more and more popular in Arabia and more and more Eastern Christians were beginning to adopt the Muslim custom of aniconism, or absence of religious images or statues. Politically, this would ease relations with Islam, but also clerically, the Iconoclasts believed that any depictions of Jesus Christ would be flawed, either by depicting Him as a purely physical being, or confusing His two natures as both God and Man. In the 8th and early 9th Centuries, Iconoclasm grew to power significantly, and many religious artifacts, paintings, and statues were destroyed by the zealots. The Clergy hold a particularly high place in society, as they are often tasked with deciding whether an item is a genuine holy artifact, or a blasphemous copy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
illuyanka_DESC;The cult of Illuyanka is an Heretical Archaic Hittite faith of Traditional soul. According to ancient Hittite legend, the sky god Tarhunt defeated the serpent dragon Illuyanka in battle and emerged as the supreme divine entity. As the Isaurian Emperor Leo III reformed the beliefs of the Chosen People of Light (the Luwians) to adapt the creed to his imperial agenda, some remote communities led by Leo III's own bastard daughter resisted the changes brought by the religious reforms. Their doctrinal opposition went so far at to defy orthodox Luwian dogma by claiming that the dragon Illuyanka actually vanquished Tarhunt and emerged as the supreme divine entity, guiding his followers through the ages of darkness to come. Illuyankan worshippers maintain isolated, secretive, and defiant communities, resistant towards the external world - Luwian or else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
illuyanka_reformed_DESC;The Typhonist faith is a Mainstream Archaic Hittite religion of Messianic soul, characterized by strong Greco-Roman influences. It is an attempt to reconcile the existence of Illuyanka and other Hittite gods, and to further organize the cult, integrating it into mainstream Hellenistic religious practises. Illuyanka fuses with the Greek Typhon, "the Father of all monsters", Tarhunt is also syncretized, with Zeus. In the new Typhonist theology the great battle ensues once more, but this time Thyphon-Illuyanka emerges victorious and subdues Tarhunt-Zeus by blinding him, instead of killing him. The other Hittite-Olympian gods are also subdued and become servants of the Great Dragon. Hedammu-Ladon, a servant of Illuyanka-Typhon, is said to imbue mortal protectors with the strength of the Great Dragon. These mortals keep the fire at the Temple of Illuyanka-Typhon lit and continue to venerate him as a savior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

indoh_bud_DESC;The Eusebeian faith is a Local Greco-Roman faith of Statist soul, characterized by strong Buddhist influences. The Indo-Hellenic world eagerly supported philosophical movements, and thus when Emperor Ashoka sought to promote Buddhism, he spoke in Greek terms. Explicitly that the Buddhist concept of Dhrama was "Eusebeia", a Greek term meaning "Right reverence". This faith later became supported as a state religion by other rulers following Emperor Ashoka. The highly adaptable nature of Buddhist teachings meant that it easily co-exists with other creeds and religious traditions. Many of the deities and heroes of Greek and Indian legends are regarded as Bodhisattvas, those who have attained enlightenment and seek to help mortals reach enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
indoh_confucian_DESC;The teachings of Konphosios are a Local Greco-Roman philosophic faith of Statist soul, characterized by strong Chinese influences. When Empress Alexandra I of the Helleno-Chinese issued in 11 CE the edict of Alexandria Changana, she created a strong meritocratic bureaucracy system based on Confucian principles and Hellenistic values. Under this three-way Indian, Hellenic and Chinese syncretic system, many cults and sects combining spirits and deities from all those mythologies arose. It is thus not surprising to see temples to the Greek and Indian gods next to an Chinese ancestral shrine, mystics practicing both Taoist magic and Theurgy, and scholars mixing the teachings of Konphosios and Socrates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
indoh_hindu_DESC;Sindhian Hinduism is a Local Greco-Roman faith of Statist soul, characterized by strong Indian influences. The Sindhian school of Hinduism emerged in 155 BCE following Menander's conquest of Sri Lanka. Many Indo-Hellenic reforms, rituals, and interpretations have been merged with the Hindu faith to create one of the largest state-run theological schools in India. Routine rituals and festivals are performed by an ordained member of the Vedic Brotherhood, and often resemble traditional Hindu rituals with a heavy Hellenic influence, in both practice and iconography. The Vedic Brotherhood was founded by Menander in an effort to subdue the Local populace and further the Hellenization of India.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
indoh_zor_DESC;Pyromantism is a Local Greco-Roman religion of Statist soul, characterized by strong Iranian influences, the result of centuries of syncretism between Greeks and Iranians in the Eastern satrapies of Bactria, Sogdiana and Arachosia, unstable lands of volatile leaders and uneasy masters. It is a subtle blend of Hellenic gods and religious patterns with Sogdian Zoroastrian cosmology, old Iranian deities and Far Eastern themes, built around grand public rituals, divination by fire and the worship of great heroic figures considered as Yazatas (minor deities) and Devae (spirits), all falling under the supreme command of Horomasdes (Ahura-Mazda), the force of Light and Order in the World, First Emanation of Zarvanes Bythos, Time Primordial. The most prominent of the Yazatas include:\n Verethraghna, God of victory.\n Herakles and his mate Tyche, Guardian of cities.\n Mithra, the Seal of Truth and oaths.\n Athena-Nanaiya, the Martial Goddess ever escorted by a Lion.\n Aredvi Sura Anahita, divinity of waters.\n The winged bull Gopatshah source of all life.\n Megabaies (Vayu-Shiva).\n Buddha the king-god.\n\n Long ago, this pantheon of divine beings sealed a pact with the Prophet and King of Men, Megas Alexandros, who became Horomasdes’ adoptive Son. When Megas Alexander set fire to Persepolis and defeated the Persian holders of lies, Horomasdes recognized in Him a worthy Hero, the Saoshyant of our Time. Through the great beacon of Persepolis burning, the Light entered Alexander and guided Him to His Fate. His steps led him to the divine Rowkhshan, unborn reincarnation of Athena-Nanaiya, who conquered His heart and brought Him to a higher plane, where He was assigned the most sacred of missions by Horomasdes: to banish Lie and Darkness from this world. To accomplish this mission he reached to both the Eastern and Western ends of the Earth, where he fought Ahriman and made him flee, and enclosed many of his beasts behind the Iron Gates of Caucassus Indicus. This is just one of a series of battles, works and quests that the greatest heroes of myth did while inspired by Horomasdes, while Zurvan Bythos brings the Last Day forth, slow but steady, and sets everyone's Destiny. The Pyromantic cosmogony was largely shaped by Indohellenic Kings, claiming divine descent from Rowkhshan and Alexander and thus divine nature, who recognized the cult’s potential as a way to bring their diverse peoples closer together, thanks to this faith's flexibility with foreign deities and its mythical Iranian-Greek ancestry on an almost equal basis. Fire rituals have only grown stronger with time, with sacrificial pyres being set in festivals and celebrations. The King has the monopoly of receiving purification by holy fire at every Spring, under the auspices of State priests. During this ceremony, the King renews Megas Alexandros’ divine link to Horomasdes by crossing Fire untouched while 39 unworthy individuals, holders of lies, perish by his side in the flames of Justice. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
indohelen_DESC;The Indo-Hellenic faith is a Local Greco-Roman religion of Traditional soul. As the Greeks conquered Transoxiane and beyond, they brought their own belief system in these lands but also met new ones. When Local princes did not favor one influence over the others, conquerors and commoners gradually integrated these new elements into the classical Hellenistic pantheon. Greeks were willing to acknowledge and in some cases even promote Indian deities they encountered in the northwestern subcontinent. While Buddhism, Hinduism, and Zoroastrianism have all had a sizeable influence on the development of the Indo-Hellenic religion, certain religions feature more prominently in various strains of this faith, and while some of these denominations may have cut ties and established a canon doctrine, the mainstream movement has maintained balance through the ever-changing times. The Hellenistic element remains dominant and aggregates all these elements: it not uncommon to see Zeus in presence of a both a Buddhist lion and the Hindu goddess Lakshmi in a single temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
indohelen_reformed_DESC;The Indolatreian ( "Indian Worship" ) faith is a Reformed Mainstream Greco-Roman faith with a Statist soul and strong Indian influences. It is an evolution of the Indo-Hellenic faith that already was a synchronization of Indian and Greek beliefs and ideas. Further evolution with ideas from Persia and Buddhism, have had an impact to the faith. The Greek aspects dominate the faith, yet it is not uncommon to see people go to a temple of Lakshmi one day and a temple to Hermes another day or to see the art telling the stories of Athena and Buddha within the same temple. The priesthood has evolved into a highly organized priesthood with the most powerful king ruling as the head priest of the religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Irminsul are great pillars made of holy trees which unite Earth and Sky, and through which the Divine can be approached, felt, and understood. Only the caste of priests is authorized to approach the Irminsul. During occult ceremonies held at irregular intervals, according to a calendar only known to those initiated, Wodanaz himself enters in communion with the Irminsul, communicates with the priests, and grants his protection to those who deserve it. It is said that Widukind was the only non-priest authorized to meet the greatest Irminsul just after defeating Charlemagne in 777 CE, when his spirit merged with the totems. The priests attending Irminsul enjoy a great authority over their communities. They accuse other Germanic beliefs which allow laymen to pray Wotan directly of being heretical, insulting to the Irminsul, and contrary to the essence of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The faith tends to look at other goddesses as representations of Isis.  The veneration of the ancestors, or akhu, is one of the important aspects of the faith. They also look to the past and keep many of the ancient tendencies alive. They follow the same festivals, and look backwards to the faith as they have always practiced it in the past. The clergy play a strong role in guiding the lives and speaking on behalf of the people to the gods and the ancestors. What makes the clergy different from other clergies is that baring the king of Egypt, they are only women. The head of the Osisiran faith is ruled by the king and queen of Egypt respectively, though in practice the Queen of Egypt tends to dominate the faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

jupiter_DESC;The Mos Jovis ( "Jovian Tradition" ) is a Local Greco-Roman religion of Statist soul and Christian ascendant. In the wake of the new age that the main monotheistic religions brought forth, other religions followed their path. The strong cult of Jupiter and Hercules sponsored by the Roman Empire since the times of Diocletian lived on, dwindling in number of followers but growing stronger in community and cohesion. In Anatolia, the last bastion of this tradition, it absorbed a breath of the spirit of the age and Jupiter was eventually equated with the Christian God, his bitter rival, and Juppiter Optimus Maximus, Jovis Basileus, adopted Anatolian religious traditions, the most important of which was that of Jupiter Dolichenus or Juppiter-Baal, the Commagenean King of the Gods, and its particular blend of monolatry. From then on, Jupiter was King, Judge and Genesis of the World, and in Anatolia a renewed network of Flamines and Augurs kept the temples and the sacrificial arae open and running, even in secret, if needed. The strong communal ties allowed the Jovian Tradition to make its believers everywhere in Anatolia a bastion of their own, a beacon of solidarity, and the support of the state ensures the public aspect of the rites is preserved, while the ruler also seizes the prizes of the communal faith and its Dolichene Mysteries in the unwavering faith of its followers. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kharijite_DESC;Kharijitism is an Heretical Islamic madhab of Populist soul. It constituted itself in First Islamic War in the 7th Century CE by opposing both Sunnis and Shias, and by assassinating Ali (whom they admired) because of his conciliatory attitude towards his enemy Muawiyah. Since then they have been rejecting - often violently - all forms of political leadership, citing the verse "No rule but God's." They denounce most forms of codified Islamic jurisprudence as a betrayal to God's message contained wholly in the Holy Qur'an, and consider it legitimate to kill a caliph if his acts are sinful. While sharing with other branches of Shia Islam a fascination for Ali, Kharijites violently reject the worship of individual imams and pilgrimages to imamzadeh as superstitions dangerously close to pagan idolatry. The strength of this uncompromising fundamentalist message based on Ali's legacy exercises a strong appeal among the Shias who regard their current leaders and clergy as corrupted by their drive for wealth and power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

His followers seek to follow his example as a warrior hero-deity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
luwian_DESC;The Luwian faith is a Mainstream Archaic Hittite religion of Statist soul. The religious system is a legacy of the ancient Hittite civilization, who created a complex pantheon reflecting the mosaic of peoples present in Asia Minor, under the strong influences of Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt. Many Gods co-exist with multiple identities, as a result of  successive layers of syncretism, products of the Anatolian melting-pot. Although each God has a specific area of responsibility, they are collectively responsible to guide mankind on the path of morality and piety. The traditional Luwian faith was more recently reformed when the client-king of Isauria, the long-standing Hittite heartland, conquered Constantinople with support from the Eastern legions and imposed himself as Emperor Leo III in 716 CE. He introduced the cult of the Luwian sun goddess Arinniti as the new inperial state religion: he proclaimed Sol to be the consort of Arinniti, and the Emperor to be her consort in the flesh. The subsequent decades saw a short-lived global supremacy of the imperial Luwian faith. Leo III conquered Rome and sacrificed the Western Emperor to Arinniti, imposing the Luwian faith on the entire Roman empire through well-organized persecutions of the Christians. The Luwian supremacy culminated when his son and successor, Leo Constantine, conquered Jerusalem and desecrated the Christian holy sites. Since then, in spite of the numerous set backs, the faithful still trust their divine connection to Arinniti under the leadership of Leo III's heirs, semi-divinised as the flesh of Arinniti.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

malakbel_DESC;The worship of Malakbel is a Local Archaic Canaanite religion of Traditional soul. The meaning, in Aramaic, is “Messenger of Baal”: the worship of Malakbal is traditionally strongly associated with Beelshamen’s. In the first century, the Palmyran religion focused increasingly on the trio constituted by the supreme god Beelshamên, the lunar god Aglibôl, and the sun god Malakbêl. Then came the time of the glorious Palmyrene Empire in the 3rd Century. The Emperor Odaenathus and his wife Zenobia conquered Syria, the Parthian capital and Egypt, worshipping Beelshamen in an increasingly monotheist fashion as a reflection of their own absolute dominion of the lands of men. The new religious doctrine elevated Beelshamen as a rival of Sol Invictus, Ahura Mazda and Yahweh. In this evolving cult, the new Palmyrene State attempted to merge the personality of all lesser Gods, including Malakbel, in the overwhelming figure of Beelshamen. Sacrifices to Malakbel were forbidden, and his statues and other representations were removed from the main temples. However, many lay people and lower clergymen, confused by these dramatic changes, continued addressing their prayers to Malakbel and made their best to keep some smaller representations for worship. Beelshameni nobles and high priests closed their eyes: as the Romans identified Malakbel with their own Sol Invictus, Beelshameni authorities viewed the cult of Malakbel as a potential vector for religious propaganda. More importantly, they did not perceive worshippers of Malakbel as open challengers of the Beelshamen supremacy, as made explicit by the God’s name itself. As the Empire collapsed and Palmyre returned to the status of petty kingdom, people nostalgic of the pluralist pantheon of old continued worshipping Malakbel with little opposition from the mainstream clergy. Through the figure of Malakbel, his followers worship the whole pantheon all lesser Gods threatened of oblivion and hope to maintain the ways of living of simpler times alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mand_ruha_DESC;The cult of Ruha d-Qudshai is an Heretical Gnostic faith of Traditional soul. It is the cult worship of Ruha d-Qudshai, the evil spirit allied with the Jewish Yahweh.

Ruha d-Qudshai is regarded as the Holy Spirit in the Bible, Qur'an, and Torah, but in Mandaeism, she is regarded as an evil spirit responsible for the founding of Jerusalem and, with the help of her sons, the seven planets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The cult worship of the Holy Spirit becomes more monotheistic, with Adonai in subservience to Ruha-d-Qudsha. Despite being an evil spirit in Mandaeanism, the Holy Spirit has become the Mantle of Light and the Savior of Civilization to his followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mandaean_DESC;Mandaeism is a Maninstream Gnostic religion of Traditional soul. Mandaean is a spiritually-influenced gnostic religion with a strongly-dualistic view. In Mandaeism, there are about nine features which are the fundamental tenets: 1) A supreme formless Entity, the expression of which in time and space is creation of spiritual, etheric, and material worlds and beings. Production of these is delegated by It to a creator or creators who originated in It. The cosmos is created by Archetypal Man, who produces it in similitude to his own shape. 2) Dualism is a strong feature of Mandaeism, with opposites in the cosmic universe such as Father and Mother, and Light and Darkness. 3) As a feature of this dualism, there are counter-types, a world of ideas. 4) The soul is portrayed as an exile, with home and origin being the supreme Entity to which the soul eventually returns. 5) Planets and stars influence fate and human beings, and are also places of detention after death. 6) A savior spirit or savior spirits which assist the soul on the journey through life and after it to 'worlds of light'. 7) A cult-language of symbol and metaphor. Ideas and qualities are personified. 8) 'Mysteries', i.e. sacraments to aid and purify the soul, to ensure rebirth into a spiritual body, and ascent from the world of matter. These are often adaptations of existing seasonal and traditional rites to which an esoteric interpretation is attached. In the case of the Na?oreans this interpretation is based upon the Creation story, especially on the Divine Man, Adam, as crowned and anointed King-priest. 9) Great secrecy is enjoined upon initiates, with the full explanation of the Creation Story and the 'Mysteries' being reserved for those considered able to understand and preserve the gnosis. Marriage and procreation are a part of Mandaeism, and a strong emphasis on family life is placed. There is an abstention from strong drink and red meat, however. While Mandaeans reject Jesus of Nazareth, Abraham, and Moses, other characters from Abrahamic religions such as Adam, Abel, Seth, Enoch, Noah, Shem, Aram, and especially John the Baptist are highly revered. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mandaean_reformed_DESC;Risamman Mandaeism is a Reformed Mainstream Gnostic religion of Messianic soul. The Mandaean Reformation is characterized by an organization of the incredibly complicated gnostic scripture, and the central support of a Risamma - a leader of the people.

mani_DESC;Manichaeism is a Mainstream Gnostic religion of Messianic soul, with strong Persian influences. A religion based on the teachings of Mani, a prophet originally from Persia. Similarly to Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism features a conflict between light and darkness. With Manichaeism, however, the conflict is mainly internal, and the struggle of good vs. evil is characterized by the struggle between Primal Man and Satan. It also plays out over the world, but things like the earth and the flesh are not seen as inherently good or evil, but rather possessed by light or darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mani_ahriman_DESC;The cult of Ahriman is an Heretical Gnostic sect of Messianic soul, with strong Steppe influences. It is a cult worshipping the Manichaean king of darkness, Ahriman, in an effort to bring about total darkness on the world. Followers of Ahriman seek to throw away the balance between shadow and light in the world and bring back the World of Darkness, the realm of their master, that existed since primordial times. They will fight zealously against all those who stand in their way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mani_germanic_DESC;The teachings of Wulfila are a Local Gnostic religion of Statist soul, with strong Barbarian influences. A syncretic Germano-Manichaean faith, it features the traditional light vs darkness dualism element shown in all other Manichaean religions. The traditional Germanic focus on Wodanaz moves to a deity known as Auzawandilaz, "the luminous wanderer", who wages eternal war against the forces of the Muþspell, "the world destroyers". Their conflict is said to end in a cataclysmic event that will cover the world in flames, but thanks to Auzawandilaz humanity will endure and rebuild. It is named after it's founder, Wulfila, a Gothic-Greek that translated and adapted the Gospel of Mani to evangelize the Germanic tribes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mani_germanic_reformed_DESC;The Woriibarstist ( "North-Western" ) faith is a Mainstream Gnostic religion of Statist soul, with strong Barbarian influences. The luminous wanderer Auzawandilaz becomes the one and only source of light for the reformed Wulifists. Even Wodanaz himself is viewed as an evil being attempting to steal followers from the one true Light. As the rest of the world marches towards cataclysm and darkness, the worshippers of Auzawandilaz are steadfast in their enlightened faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mani_mithra_DESC;The Theomachian ( "Battle of the Gods" ) cult is a Local Gnostic religion of Martial soul, with strong Persian influences. It is a syncretic faith composed by many elements of Greco-Roman mythology, Manichaeism, and Mithraism via its great success within the Roman military, turning to the idea that the world is the battleground of the Gods and that all life is part of the Battle between life and death, light and shadow, and that each mortal must give their all in the fight against the forces of darkness. Theomachians believe that all those who do not partake in their endeavor are servants of darkness and are to be destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mani_slavic_DESC;The teachings of Dragomir are a Local Gnostic religion of Populist soul with, strong Slavic Barbarian influences. Created by the Manichaean priest Dragomir in the latter half of the 9th Century CE, Dragomirism claims that the universe is an arena of eternal war between the Creator God (often identified with Rod) and the evil, chaotic dragon Zmey. Zmey is the creator of the material world, which he planned to use to corrupt the Creator God's pure divine creation. According to Dragomirist theology, humans are the only material beings possessing a soul - and as such are the only ones that can stand up against Zmey in this eternal struggle. Dragomirist beliefs incorporate the majority of Slavic pantheon - deities like Perun, Svarog and Dazhbog are lesser beings who attempt to harness Zmey's matter and turn it against its master. Dragomirists constitute small autonomous communities sharing all material properties, centered around the performing of esoteric rituals aiming at exorcising Zmey and bringing forth spiritual purity in this world. These Dragomirist communities are enthusiastic to fight Zmey's servants, but they often make for extremely unruly subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mani_slavic_reformed_DESC;The Woriijadtist ( "North-Eastern" ) faith is a Reformed Mainstream Gnostic faith of Statist soul, with strong Slavic Barbarian influences. As Dragomirism developed, the old Slavic gods decreased in importance over time until only Dragomir-Rod remained: he prophet himself deified as Rod's earthly form. Zmey, "the dragon of darkness", remains, although his power is far less than that of Dragomir-Rod.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
marabout_DESC;The sect of the Marabouts is a Local Islamic faith of Traditional soul, with strong Saharan influences.

The marabout is often an expert on Islam and the Qur'an, and his followers adhere to him as they would to a prophet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
marcionist_DESC;Marcionism is a Local Christian creed of Scholarly soul, characterized by strong Gnostic influences. Marcion of Sinope was a bishop who was living in Pontus during the times of early Christianity. Influenced by Gnostic dualist theory, he believed and taught that the wrathful Hebrew god Yahweh was a separate and lower entity than the all-forgiving God of the New Testament. For Marcionists, Christ was not the Jewish Messiah but a spiritual entity that was sent by God to reveal the truth about existence, and thus allowing humanity to escape the earthly trap of the demiurge Yahweh. In spite of strong doctrinal opposition from the official Church, Marcionism remained predominant in the relatively isolated Pontus area, where it developed in isolation from other Christian currents. A particular feature of that creed is the development of a thorough alternative canon of scriptures, compiled even before the Catholic canonical Gospel. Believers emphasize the analysis of the Marcionist canon, composed of eleven books, which provide keys for analyzing this world in a moral, almost platonic perspective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mari_christ_DESC;Euskalism is a Local Christian movement of Traditional soul with a Barbarian ascendant. Euskalism is a hybrid religion focusing on the belief that the Virgin Mary was the incarnation of Mari, the goddess of the Euskal people. The movement developed in Euskalia as a Local synthesis between Arianism and more ancient Local beliefs. Believers follow many Christian beliefs and practices but put a heavy emphasis on the veneration of Mari (also equated with the Virgin Mary). Each village or community follows the spiritual directions of a virgin crone, often a kind of village elder, whose religious influence supersedes that of the standard Christian clergy. Traditionally, it is only the virgin crones who have the authority to select and give sacraments to Euskalist priests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mari_christ_reformed_DESC;The Marian Church is a Mainstream Christian religion of Clerical soul, with strong Barbarian influences. Marianism is an effort to codify and doctrinalize all the existent Virgin Mary-centric cults of Christianity. The references to the Basque goddess Mari have been all but erased from formal liturgy and scriptures, for the faith to be more acceptable to non-Basques for conversion. The tradition of consulting virgin crones and the clergy have been fused into one: in a strange aversion of normal Christian orthodoxy, Marianist priesthood places greater emphasis on the women's role in the priesthood, while men are allowed to have minor, non-administrative positions. While the ruler is the official head of the Church, chosen by the Virgin Mary, every action related to the Church has to be sanctioned by the Marianist Clergy, so it's not clear who truly holds the power in the Church. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
maturidi_DESC;The Maturidi school is a Local Islamic sect of Clerical soul. It is an Islamic school of thought that broke off from the Ash'ari school, founded by Abu Mansur Al Maturidi. The main premise is that, contrary to Ash'ari ideology, belief (iman) does not change, but rather piety is what increases and decreases. Both the Ash'ari and Athari sects believe that iman does increase and decrease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdakism_DESC;The Mazdakist movement is an Heretical Persian faith of Populist soul. A heresy of Zoroastrianism as brought about by Mazdak, a religious prophet. According to Mazdak, humanity should enjoy the pleasures of life and satisfy their appetite in the highest degree in regards to eating and drinking in the spirit of equality, as well as to aim at good deeds, abstention from causing harm to others, and practicing hospitality without reservation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdakism_reformed_DESC;Desnadite Mazdakism is a Mainstream Persian religion of Messianic soul. The namesake of the Desnadi religion - the Desnadi itself, is a series of religious tales said to have been written by Mazdak long ago - becomes the official scripture of the Mazdakite religion. A returned emphasis on Light and Dark and the Good/Evil dichotomy characterizes this reformed Zoroastrian religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
melkite_DESC;The Melkite Church is an Heretical Christian creed of Clerical soul. Melkites view themselves as the first Christian community, dating the Melkite movement back to the time of the Apostles. During the bitter debates occurring at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 CE, the official Church imposed its vision of a dual nature of the Christ. This declaration sparked tensions among Syriac Christians. The anti-Chalcedonians (mostly rural Syriac speakers) accused the Chalcedonians (mostly Hellenized urban dwellers) of following the Pope, or "king" (in Syriac, "malka"), and thus called them "Melkites". In the 8th century, when Leo III and his successor Leo Constantine organized violent persecutions against Christians, the Melkites negotiated relative respite for their communities by supporting the emperor's agents. The Pope had no choice but to excommunicate them, and the Melkite clergy in turn declared the church in Rome heretical while delivering those loyal to the Pope to the Imperium Romanum's persecution. This treason to their brothers in faith isolated the Melkite community, but allowed it to survive up to today in the midst of a hostile environment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mithra_DESC;The cult of Mithras is a Mainstream Gnostic religion of Martial soul. It is a cult venerating Mithras, a Roman deity based off the Zoroastrian divinity of covenant and oath, Mitra. Worshippers of Mithras have a complex system of seven grades of initiation, with ritual meals. Iconic scenes of Mithraic mythology include Mithras being born out of rock, him hunting and slaughtering a sacred bull with his bare hands and holding banquets with Sol. Very popular with the Roman soldiery, various military enclaves of the former Roman Empire now hold Mithraism as their state cult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mithra_christ_DESC;The cult of Mithras-Christos is  Local Gnostic faith of Martial soul, with strong Christian influences. Mithraic-Christians, also often called Tauraimanians ( "Blood of the Bull" ) are an heretical sect of Mithraism which believes that Jesus of Nazareth was the incarnation of Mithra, "Mithras-Christos". It combines many Mithraic and Christian elements. But the core belief is that Christ is Mithra made flesh as Redeemer of the World. Mithraic-Christianity is very different in its message in that it is highly militant, the faithful believe in sacrificing themselves in "fighting evil" at all costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mithra_sol_DESC;The cult of Eosphoros ( "Lightbringer" ) is a Local Greco-Roman faith of Martial soul, with strong Gnostic influences. Eosphorism is an union of Mithras and Sol into a new figure Eosphoros - The Dawn Bringer. Elements of the Judaeo-Christian tradition are also included, Eosphoros is Lucifer, and a direct Enemy of Christianity. Eosphorism sees the Dawn Bringer as the True God and Creator of Humanity, with Christianity being an abomination to be exterminated. It is a highly militaristic anti-Christian religion. Partly as a reaction against-Christianity, Eosphoros becomes Lucifer. Part of his mythology is centered around his Battle with Yahweh and Christ. He is the true Creator of Humanity and Redeemer, the Fallen God, rising again in the Morning. He overcomes Yahweh who is seen as an Oppressor God, to help liberate humanity and bring Salvation. He is a Lord of Hosts, a Battle-Lord of the Morning, locked in battle with Yahweh, until his future victory and Redemption of Humanity in His Light. Followers believe that Eosphoros' light will bring harmony to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monophysite_DESC;Monophysitism is a Mainstream Christian denomination of Clerical soul. It is a byproduct of the theological School of Alexandria, which began its Christological analysis with the eternal Son, the Word of God made flesh, and sought to explain how this eternal Word had come to Earth as a man. Monophysites claim that, after the union of the divine and the human in the historical Incarnation, Jesus Christ, as the incarnation of the eternal Word of God, had only a single nature which was either divine or a synthesis of divine and human. Monophysitism was condemned by the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451 CE, in which the Definition of Chalcedon, which maintains that Christ maintained one divine nature and one human nature after the Incarnation, was adopted. The Chalcedonian settlement encountered strong resistance in the Eastern fringes of the Roman Empire, leading ultimately to the schism of the Oriental Orthodox churches. The Monophysite Church took root where Local kings were trying to differentiate themselves from the official Roman church, mainly in the Caucasus and Aegyptus. The Monophysite Church thrived and organized itself in these distant locations. Monophysites have developed their own rites and use clearly differentiated divine liturgies and iconographies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monothelite_DESC;The Monothelites are a Local Christian sect of Clerical soul. A sect of Orthodox Christianity that believes that Jesus had two natures (one divine, one human) but one will. This is in contrast to the common belief that Christ had two wills and two natures, relatively corresponding to each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
montanist_DESC;Montanism is an Heretical Christian sect of Clerical soul, with heavy Greco-Roman influences. Its founder Montanus, a mystic from Phrygia, launched a movement called "The New Prophecy" in the 2nd Century CE. This "New Prophecy" spread rapidly to other regions in the Roman Empire at a time when Christianity was not yet recognized or tolerated in the Western Empire. Montanus was a recent convert when he first began receiving revelation. He believed he was a prophet of God and asserted that New Jerusalem would appear in Phrygia. He insisted the Holy Trinity had precedence over Jesus, who he claimed was a mere initiator of his own prophecies. During his divinations, Montanus emulated the oracles of the Greco-Roman world and spoke in the first person as God, claiming direct divine inspiration. Montanism remains a movement focused around prophecy, specifically the prophecies of the uninterrupted lines of "New Prophets", chosen at each generation by the Wise Amongst The Wise. These prophecies, formulated from the Montanist Oracle in Phrygia, are believed to contain the Holy Spirit's revelation for the present age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
montanist_reformed_DESC;The Phrygian Church is a Mainstream Christian denomination of Statist soul. The Phrygian reformation is characterized by a religious head who interprets the readings of oracles as well as organized scripture to help them do so.

murjiah_DESC;The Murji'ah are a Local Islamic school of Statist soul. It is a school of Islamic thought that focuses on the idea that only Allah has the right to judge others, and that sin and "levels of believerhood" should not be such an important factor to Muslims, as Muslims should regard all other Muslims as believers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

muslim_sufi_reformed_DESC;Sufi Islam is a Reformed Mainstream Islamic denomination of Traditional soul. This denomination of Islam focuses on the importance of Islamic jurisprudence as underlined by the early Islamic philosopher Al-Shafi'i. It emphasizes proper istinbaat (derivation of laws) through the rigorous application of legal principles as opposed to speculation or conjecture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mutazil_DESC;The Mu'tazilite school is a Local Islamic school of Clerical soul. It is a school of theology based on reason and rational thought. There is an assertion that, because God is perfect and divine, the Qur'an must have been created and therefore cannot be co-eternal with God. From this premise, the Mu'tazili school of thought proceeds to posit that the injunctions of God are accessible to rational thought and inquiry: because knowledge is derived from reason, reason is the "final arbiter" in distinguishing right from wrong. It follows, in Mu'tazili reasoning, that "sacred precedent" is not an effective means of determining what is just, as what is obligatory in religion is only obligatory by virtue of reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mwari_DESC;The cult of Mwari is a Local Bantu Shamanic religion of Traditional soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nasrani_DESC;The Nasrani ("Nazarenes") are a Local Christian religion of Traditional soul, with significant Indian influences. The Nasrani Church in India is one of the oldest Christian denominations; it that traces its roots to st. Thomas the Apostle, but it only begun to grow significantly near the end of the 2nd century, when more numerous groups of missionaries managed to make their way through the troubled Hellenic India to the South-Western part of the peninsula. There, to their great surprise, they found a Jewish community (with some Christians converted by st. Thomas), coexisting with Hindu natives whose stories and philosophies were sometimes disturbingly familiar. The missionaries delved into the local traditions carefully and came up with the only possible explanation - they have found the land were Christ travelled to during the mysterious period before the Baptism in Jordan, the land of heathens who in Jesus' own words would come to replace the Jews as the Chosen People. Many local sacred epics were reinterpreted as either distorted versions of Old Testament stories or tales of local Prophets - such as Krishna and Buddha - who were sent to clear the path for the coming of Christ. For the next centuries the members of the Church worked on collecting the local beliefs and explaining them through the lens of the Gospel, gaining many converts in the process with their blending of traditional Indian narratives and elements such as Karmic balance with the message of hope and love, aimed at the lower strata and denouncing the religious warfare that India was torn apart by. Religious practices of Nasrani combine Christian ceremonies not unlike those practiced among the first Christians, local Hindu rituals now used to venerate God, Christ and the Holy Spirit, and also recitation of tales about lives of the Holy Men from Old and New Testament as well as local holy epics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nasrani_reformed_DESC;The Malankarans are a Mainstream Indian religion of Statist Soul, with strong Christian influences;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
neoplato_DESC;The teachings of Neoplatonism are a Gnostic Mainstream religion of Scholarly soul, with a strong Greco-Roman ascendancy. In many ways the mystical Neoplatonism is the culmination of Greco-Roman religious thought. Drawing from traditional religious practice, mystery cults, orientalism, and the philosophical tradition, Neoplatonism presents an organized, and in the view of its practitioners definitive, revival of traditional Hellenistic practices. Essentially, the tenets include belief in the One and Infinite, the source of all life in the universe. Since it is beyond the level of being, it cannot be understood or comprehended, according to Plato. Since it is beyond being, it is limitless, attribute-less, and magnitude-less. It is neither good nor bad, as morality would imply limitation. The One emanates nous, the perfect image of the One. This nous is simultaneously being and thought, and could be summarized by pure intellect. This is the highest level obtainable by man, and the nous corresponds perfectly to the One but is distinct and separate, as nothing reaches the level of the One. Under the One, there are three levels of celestial hierarchy: the Hypercosmic Gods, who make Essence, Life, and Soul, the Demiurge, known as the creator, and the Cosmic Gods, who make Being, Nature, and Matter. The last category would include the gods known in other pantheons. Neoplatonism started to win popularity in the cities of the Eastern Empire in 229 AD. During 362 AD, the ritual aspect of Neoplatonism, theurgy, served as the backdrop for Emperor Julian’s reforms, who made it rise to the status of state religion, now promoted by the state education of the empire. When Christian mobs started rampaging across the Eastern Empire in response to Emperor Julian’s policies, culminating with the assassination of the Scholarch of Athens, the foremost intellectual authority in Neoplatonist matters, at their hands, Julian decided to start the “Sacred Policies of Purification” in order to preserve “the Light of Civilization”, the purge against, as he saw them, the barbaric Christians. After the assassination of Julian’s daughter at the hands of a Christian fanatic whom he had previously pardoned, all Christians who refused to abandon their faith were executed. Many Neoplatonist scholars consider the “Sacred Purifications” one the darkest times of their history. Nowadays, Neoplatonism champions the deification of the soul through the ineffable eros of and union with the One. For many schools, it takes the form of an integrated combination of knowledge and practice, both of Neoplatonism and traditional Greek philosophy. For many schools, the goal of this philosophical way of life is a form of self-deification: knowledge (episteme) makes one a divine man (theios aner). Even though Neoplatonists scholars gather in councils at academies all around the world, the greatest philosophers and thinkers discuss the teachings and ethos of Neoplatonism at the Neoplatonist Academy, in Athens. The Scholarch is considered the foremost intellectual authority in Neoplatonism, and is usually elected by a council of the greatest philosophers and thinkers all around the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nestorian_DESC;Nestorianism is a Mainstream Christian religion of Messianic soul, characterized by strong Persian influences. It originates from the theological School of Antioch, which based its Christology on the human Jesus of the Gospels and sought to explain how this man had become united with the eternal Word in the Incarnation. Nestorius, the bishop of Constantinople in the 5th Century CE, emphasized the disunion between the human and divine natures of Jesus. The Church rejected these teachings and exiled him. Fleeing both the Church and the Eastern Emperor Imperator Alexandros X's persecutions against all sorts of Christians - heretical or not - Nestorius and his supporters relocated to Sassanid Persia. They affiliated with the Local Christian community, which became increasingly Nestorian in doctrine. Persian scholars expanded on the teachings of Nestorius and his mentors, particularly after the relocation of the School of Edessa, a theological school of great importance to the Syriac speaking world, to the Persian city of Nisibis in 489 CE. Throughout the 6th Century, the church was frequently beset with internal strife and persecution from the Zoroastrians, and even experienced a schism it could hardly overcome. Eventually, the church emerged stronger after this period of ordeal, and increased missionary efforts in spite of complex relationships with the Persian rulers. Indeed, the Sassanid dynasty has developed a patronizing attitude to the Nestorians, seeing them as "good Christians" out of the realm of Lie, if yet not fully enlightened - a pragmatic doctrine which they used to gain support from their own Nestorian minority and impose Nestorianism as the leading Christian church, under strong control by the State. With the weakening of the Sassanid dynasty, the Nestorian church is now free from any form of State control. Nestorian clerics are convinced that a new golden age has arrived, and the Church has entered the 11th Century full of ambition and ready to unite the peoples of the East under the sign of the Cross.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
norse_christ_DESC;Scandinism is a Local Norse sect of Statist soul, characterized by strong Christian influences. Viking raids on Frankish kingdoms and the British Isles brought the Scandinavians in contact with Christianity. Some of the Forn Siðric rulers decided to formally embrace Christianity as they seek a broader source of legitimacy towards their trouble-making vassals than the old tribal links. Thus Norse Christianity, or "Scandinism", adopted Christian monotheism and doctrinal elements that strengthen the monarch's rule as divine right, while rejecting any form of authority from the official church. It retains many typically Norse cultural elements in the new syncretic faith. The religion has not yet developed its canon but most Scandinists hold that Balder, who died and went to the underworld guarded by Hel, is the true Christ. THey reject the Latin "Hvítakristr": "White Christ", with "White" being associated with the Catholic sacerdotal robes but also with coward and effeminate attributes. Scandinist clergy make a point to wear orange or dress garbs and bears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
norse_christ_reformed_DESC;The church of Kristr Baldr is a Mainstream Norse religion of Statist soul with, strong Christian influences. It's followers are known as Kristatrúar ( "Followers of Christ" ). It goes further than the Scandianist faith in that it re-emphasizes veneration of most Norse gods as saints under Christ who is merged with Baldr to form one "Great Allsavior".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
norse_pagan_DESC;The Forn Siðr ( "Old Custom" ) is a Mainstream Norse faith of Traditional soul. It refers to the polytheistic religious traditions of the Norse people. Many gods and goddesses are worshipped and venerated, and even though adherents may specialize their worship to a particular god or goddess, all deities in the pantheon are believed in. Practices include ancestor worship and remembrance, blots, and sacrifices -sometimes humans. Other mythological creatures, such as giants, dwarves, elves, etc. are also a part of this religion. There are also nine homeworlds which the followers believe the gods used to shape the world we live in today: Midgardr (land of the humans), Asgardr (land of the Aesir), Vanaheimr (land of the Vanir), Jotunheimr (land of the giants), Alfheimr (land of the elves), Hel (land of the dead), Svartalfaheimr (land of the dwarves), Niflheimr (land of ice), and Muspellsheimr (land of fire).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
norse_pagan_reformed_DESC;Ásatrú ( "Allegiance to the Gods" ) is a Reformed Mainstream Norse faith of Statist soul.

The church has a standardized liturgy and a formal church hierarchy led by the Fylkir, who is both a secular ruler and the religious leader of the faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
norse_war_DESC;The Ófriðartívar ( "Gods of War" ) cult is an Heretical Norse faith of Martial soul. It is an off-shooting branch of Norse religious traditions focusing on the veneration of the war gods of Norse legends: Odin, Tyr, and Freya, with a strong emphasis on their roles as mighty warriors. Adherents believe that if they worship these gods specifically, they will be granted victory in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
northern_sun_reformed_DESC;The cult of Sehul is a Mainstream Solar Barbarian religion of Statist soul. It is a Solar reformation of several religions that previously syncretized paganism and sun worship. Sun gods of respective faiths are elevated into a monotheistic worship fashion: these range from the Germanic Sunna to the Baltic Saule, but all are seen as the reincarnation of Sehul, the primal god of the sun. Hundreds of years of syncretism and evolution have led the barbaric north into the warm shining Light!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

orthodox_DESC;Orthodoxy is a Mainstream Christian denomination of Statist soul. The principal belief, shared with all other Christian creeds, is that prophet Jesus of Nazareth, living in the 1st century CE, was the son of God who died on the cross and was resurrected to redeem the whole of humanity and deliver it from sin. Still, continuous theological disputes fueled by political divergences - about the nature of the Trinity and the Holy Spirit or organization of the Church - have resulted in gradual splintering. The Pope Benedict VIII's preaching of a crusade against the Eastern Empire has resulted in the Great Schism of 1019 CE, when high Christian officials decided to support their Emperor rather than follow the Pope's call to revolt. This move has resulted in Orthodoxy severing all ties with the Roman Catholicism, an unprecedented division. The Eastern Roman Empire, although generally hostile to Christians, took the pragmatic step to support the institutionalization of the Orthodox Partiarchate in Orchid in order to limit the subversive influence of Rome's spiritual leadership over its own Christian population. Compared to Roman Catholicism, Orthodoxy has a much more sophisticated cult of sacred images ('icons'), a strong monastic movement with emphasis put on ascetic practices and a very decentralized internal organization. While Roman Catholics follow the pope's authority, each Orthodox community has an autonomous patriarch, with the ecumenical patriarch considered to be first among the equals. Not having a strong independent church organization, Orthodox patriarchs tend to rely on Local rulers for material backing, and generally develop mutual legitimation relationships with relevant political authorities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
palmyran_pagan_DESC;The worship of the Elohim ( "Gods" ) is a Local Archaic Canaanite faith of Traditional soul. It refers to the religious traditions of the Canaanite, Phoenician and Nabatean peoples. It is mainly polytheistic, with some monolastic (recognizing many gods, but worshipping one or a few) tendencies. The main gods of the Elohimi pantheon are Ba'al Hadad (God of Storms and the King of the Gods), Ashtart (Goddess of the Fertility and War ), Melqart ( King of Cities and God of Merchants ) and Eshmun (God of Healing), but it also includes many Local Nabatean deities, and patron gods of Canaanite and Phoenician city states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
peckols_DESC;The cult of Peckols is a Local Baltic Barbarian faith of Clerical soul. They worship the two deities of the underworld, Peckols and Patollo. The two are actually one god, formed in two separate entities. The god(s) is/are seen as an angry, evil spirit, known for haunting and taunting the living if the dead were not buried with proper rituals or if the living disobeyed the pagan priests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pelagian_DESC;Pelagianism is an Heretical Christian faith of Clerical soul. Originating from the theology of the monk Pelagius in 380 CE, Pelagians hold that Adam never incurred any "original sin", only that he set a bad example for humanity. Consequently, humanity is not doomed to sin, but instead chooses to sin of its own free will. Therefore, the "original sin" did not taint humanity and mankind is capable of choosing right and wrong without need of divine aid. This belief directly opposes that of the Catholic Church, which claims that man is inherently evil and that man cannot come to God without the grace of God, symbolized by the Baptism. The Pelagian believers have their own well-structured clergy and are deeply convinced of the heretical nature of mainstream Catholicism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
perkunas_DESC;The cult of Perkunas is a Local Baltic Barbarian faith of Traditional soul. It refers to the polytheistic religious traditions of the Baltic peoples, with the god of thunder, Perkunas, as the king of the gods. Dievas is also seen as a supreme god, but in the mainstream doctrine of Baltic paganism, Perkunas has a level of admiration that Dievas does not quite reach, mostly due to his rivalry with the devil. The devil, rather than a malevolent, all-encompassing, corrupting evil, is seen more as a trickster, stealing cattle and weapons, and then hiding in rocks and trees. When Perkunas comes to do battle, it is in the form of a thunder-storm, after which weapons and cattle are returned. Perkunas is also seen as the creator of weapons, or at least the concept of weaponry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
perun_DESC;The worship of Perun is a Mainstream Slavic religion of Martial soul. Perun is the creator and god of lightning, as well as ruler of the world. He is usually depicted as a tall man with a golden moustache, a silver head, a copper beard, and armed with a mighty axe. Under Nordic influences, most Slavs tend to grant him a loose prominence among all their Gods. The cult doesn't have established temples - believers convene at sacred oak woods, where they sacrifice oxen and other livestock. Perunic adherents believe he is also the god of light, fighting an eternal struggle against Veles - the god of underworld. It is said that whenever a lightning strikes, it was an attempt by Perun to kill Veles. Believers take it upon themselves to take part in this holy struggle against Veles' servitors and other enemies to the Will of Perun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
plato_christ_DESC;The beliefs and practices of Augustinism and Origenism, known overall as Platonic Christianity, constitute an Heretical Neoplatonic Gnostic philosophical-religious system of Scholarly soul under strong Christian influences. Although the fusion between Christian and Neoplatonic concepts began almost immediately, to the extent both systems had a lasting influence on one another, Platonic Christianity constitutes yet a distinct stream of ideas. It appeared to the greater public first in the Scholar Augustine of Hippo's Memories. Augustine, a great mystic and philosopher from Africa, revered by the Church and the Academy alike, began his metaphysical journey first as a Manichean believer. He later turned to Platonism and last converted to Christianity. In the decisive last years of his life, he turned again to Platonism, although not relinquishing fully the legacy of Christianity. In the opening of the 4th century, he taught his followers the ideal of a perfect system where Christian and Platonic ideals work like clockwork and God's light shines over everyone, as best spelled out in his famous “City of God”. His teachings became widespread among the educated classes of great cities of Italy and Africa - in the East, the disciples of Origen had already, in the 3rd Century, established a thriving community of intellectual exchange of Christian and Platonic ideas. Augustinists travelled constantly between Carthage, Rome, Arles, Syracuse and Alexandria, creating what is known now as the Academic Circuit that goes around the Mediterranean and beyond, as east as Gades, as north as Krakow, as south as Timbuktu and as east as Pataliputra. Following the ideas behind "The City of God", Augustinians organized themselves into an Ekklesia, a tight community of believers that want to live a virtuous, moderate life in order to attain Redemption from the One God and to feel the love of Christ the Logos, that was once made Flesh. This Ekklesia has Listeners and Virtuous, a special division of the faithful according to the nature of their soul, and a strict structure, well-organized and very centralized and coordinated. In contrast, Origenists, while welcoming of new ideas, did not believe in Augustine's "perfect society", and prefer to this day a more disperse, free and decentralized structure with bishops looking after the Local communities but no sole authority over them all. Both currents join efforts in aggressively challenging the mainstream Christian churches' religious supremacy over the Christ's legacy through debates and controversies. They all gather every five years in Alexandria and their Great Synod is an anticipated event for all scholars inclined to tolerance and free discussion. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
plato_islam_DESC;Falsafa, or Platonic Islam, is an Heretical Neoplatonic Gnostic belief of Scholarly soul under a strong Islamic ascendant. "Falsafa" is the Islamic concept of Philosophy understood as the pursuit of inquiry and understanding of the nature of the world, material and spiritual, and of the order of things. In this perspective, the One, Allah, emanated energy and matter in order to create the Universe perfect and beautiful, but the matter, intended consequence of the Creation, was a by-product of the spirit, and thus trapped in its own inadequacy to perceive the higher elements of the Universe.  Ever since the First Arab Siege of Alexandria on the year 641, Islamic presence in Egypt has grown dynamically without the sponsorship of strong, lasting empires to ensure its homogeneity. Thus, when the didacts and scholarchs at Alexandria began to hear about the new faith the Arabs brought with them, the Last Revelation, the Submission to the One, they imported their holy book and invited Muslim doctors in order to learn more about this new view of the world. They soon discovered it was fully compatible with Platonic ideas and that new subtleties could be introduced. Greek translations of the Qur'an were made, as well as Arabic ones of the greatest Platonic texts, resulting in a vibrant new community of Hellenized Muslims in the newly established Madrassa of Alexandria. Soon the Roman authorities considered the new belief pernicious and tried to extirpate Muslim presence from Alexandria. The Falsafis went into hiding, but always received help from their old debate companions in the Academy, the Library and the Pandidakteion. When Alexandros, the son of Philippos Argead, and a very well-cultivated scholar, was left as Exarch of Alexandria on 835, he proclaimed amnesty and religious freedom, and the Falsafis emerged once more. Alexandros' son Aretas plunged deep into Platonic Islam thanks to his lover, Fawla Hieropsina, the Great Alimah of the Alexandrian Madrassa. Muslim presence became stronger when the Fatimids besieged the City in 919, and the city came under their domain, although Kassandir Iskenderi, Cassander of Alexandria, the newly-confirmed King of Alexandria, never forgot their Hellenistic roots, nor did his people, or the Falsafis, who remain to this day within the Great Madrassa, in good terms with the Academicians and the other scholar institutions of the City, embarked on a journey of intellectual and spiritual perfection that mimics the early days of this philosophy, when the houses of wisdom were permeable to all kinds of new ideas that might help better achieve union with Allah, the One.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
plato_pythagorean_DESC;Neopythagoreanism is a Local Neoplatonist belief of Scholarly soul and strong Gnostic influences. In its origins in the First Century, it was a response to the dominating school of thought in the Hellenistic world, Stoicism, an attempt to introduce more spiritual, mystical elements to Hellenistic philosophy. Apollonius of Triana and Moderatus of Gades, disciples of Nigidus Figulus, met in what would be called the First Secret Communion and symbolically married, giving birth to the long tradition of Pythagorean same-sex marriages between companions in the faith. Then, in 179, Numenius of Apamea fused elements of Platonism with the old Pythagorean political and spiritual structure, and in what is now called the Numerian Affirmation, created the Neopythagorean School that still exists today. They believed that there was one God, the One, the Perfect Monad, of which the number One was herald and avatar, since One signifies fullness, perfection and omnipresence. From thence, the Dual appeared, the two universes, the material and the immaterial, while the Monad emanates more and more numbers and fractions that echo in our world, but that exist fully in the real world, the spiritual world, where the soul belongs and where it longs to return. They also created a hierarchy of virtues and followed an ascetic way of life in which the important was not to do good, but to have the will to do good, since the thought was more important than the flesh, the "muddy vest of decay". Neopythagoreanism influenced Neoplatonism greatly, and it was indeed another step towards Iamblichus, Plotinus and Porphyry, but the disciples of the Numerian School went on, criticizing the Neoplatonics' lack of vision of the numerological nature of the Spiritual World and becoming increasingly secretive, developing several tens of grades of acceptance, privileged orders within the School's orders, secret rites of passage that no one will reveal, mystical mysteries to unravel, and the adoration of numbers. All of this makes joining the Neopythagoreans truly a labyrinthic task worthy of Theseus. They all choose new names when they enter the School: a public one and a secret one. Names can be broken down into numbers, and thus names are powerful, but they're a metaphor for the dual world we live in: the word being the matter and the number it represents being its soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
porphyryan_DESC;Porphyryanism is a Local Greco-Roman belief of Scholarly soul. An anti-Christian branch of Neoplatonism founded by Porphyry of Tyre. Porphyry advocated that "the Gods have proclaimed Christ most pious, but the Christians are a confused and vicious sect", and as a result there is much disdain for Christianity in this sect of Neoplatonism. Porphyryans also practice vegetarianism on both spiritual and ethical grounds, under the belief that animals are as sentient as human beings, as enforced by mainstream Neoplatonism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
priscillian_DESC;Priscillianism is an Heretical Christian sect of Messianic soul, with a strong Gnostic influence. Priscillian was an Iberian ascetic mystic living in the fourth Century, who regarded the Christian life as continual intercourse with God. He created an ascetic group which thrived in spite of his execution for heresy. Its dualistic doctrine is based on the belief in the Kingdoms of Light and Darkness. Angels and men are from the Kingdom of Light and made from matter taken from God. Men received the mission to destroy the Kingdom of Darkness, but they fell and were imprisoned in human bodies. Thus both kingdoms are represented in men: the light by the Twelve Patriarchs which correspond to man's powers, and the darkness by the signs of the Zodiac and matter. Since the Twelve Patriarchs could not free man, Jesus was sent in a mortal body to release man from the curse of earthly matter. The salvation of man consists in liberation from the domination of matter, and at the center of Priscillianism is a strong call to a life of personal piety and asceticism, including celibacy, vegetarianism, and abstinence from alcohol.  This doctrine has always been under harsh repression from the mainstream Church, but the power of its ascetic message serves as the foundation for this deeply rooted sect. Priscillians do not attend churches integrated to villages and cities for their religious ceremonies, as most other Christians do. Instead, Priscillan priests organize religious and social life within the confine of a network of impregnable fortresses, which they initially developed to resist repression and invasions. Within the austere stone walls, they impose tenuous ascetic practices on themselves and their community, requiring extreme self-control in a spiritual as well as physical sense. These practices are based as much on studies of the secret scriptures as on stern training in the arts of war and murder in the name of the Christ of Light. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
priscillian_reformed_DESC;Apologetism is a Reformed Mainstream Christian denomination of Clerical soul, with strong Gnostic influences. It is named after Priscillian's writings, the "Liber Apologeticus". Now, the great fortresses of the Priscillans have been replaced by holy words. To spread the teachings of Priscillian, the teachings themselves were diluted: the extreme dark/light dichotomy is lessened and holy soldiers viewed with less admiration. The Apologetics no longer believe that the battle between light and dark will be fought on the battlefield, but instead will be fought in the hearts and minds of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
qarmatian_DESC;The Qarmatians are an Heretical Islamic sect of Messianic soul. They are a sect of Islam under the idea that a utopian Islamic republic can be formed. Vegetarianism is also one of the major practices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ragnarok_DESC;The cult of Fenrir is an Heretical Norse faith of Messianic soul. Also known as the Ragnarök cult, they focus their worship on Fenrir - the wolf destined to devour Odin - and his sons, Hati and Skoll. The Ragnarökic see the Aesir as gluttonous corrupts and the Vanir as debauched revelers. They believe that during the end of time, the Ragnarök, Fenrir will devour the Aesir, the Vanir and their corrupt realms of Ásgarðr and Vanaheimr and afterwards rule the renewed Miðgarðr with those that stood by his side, purged of the tainted influence of the Aesir and Vanir.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ragnarok_reformed_DESC;Røkkatrú ( "Allegiance to the Røkkr" ) is a Reformed Mainstream Norse faith of Messianic soul. Røkkr ( "Darkness" or "twilight" ) is a term that includes all underworld deities or beings of twilight, such as the Jötnar. The Røkkatrúar expand their worship not only to Fenrir and his sons, but to all underworld gods as well. In the times of Ragnarok, the Aesir and Vanir - the ones who ruled the earth - would be annihilated. Only the underworld would be spared and thus these gods were the only ones deserving of worship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rod_DESC;The worship of Rod is a Local Slavic Barbarian faith of Traditional soul. Rod is the oldest Slavic deity, the creator of the universe and all other gods. Even though Nordic influence resulted in some Slavs accepting Perun as a chief deity, more traditional tribes still worship Rod the Creator, as they did centuries ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
roman_imperial_DESC;The Imperial Cult is a Local Greco-Roman religion of Statist soul. The Imperial cult is an offshoot of the traditional Roman religious practices, as they evolved starting from the early Principate of Augustus. The religious practices, in a similar fashion to classical Greco-Roman beliefs, involves offerings, ranging from wine to animal sacrifices, to the gods of the classical pantheon - notably the Capitoline Triad of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva, as well as other gods like Vesta and Mars. In the Imperial Cult the worship includes the emperors as well, and some members of their families with the divinely sanctioned authority of the Roman State, guardian of the traditional values and worship of the gods. The cultus to a living emperor acknowledges his office and rule as divinely approved and constitutional: his Principate should therefore demonstrate pious respect for traditional deities and values. A deceased emperor held worthy of the honor can be voted a state divinity (divus) by the Senate and elevated as such in an act of apotheosis. The granting of apotheosis serves religious, political and moral judgment on Imperial rulers and allows living Emperors to associate themselves with a well-regarded lineage of Imperial divi from which unpopular or unworthy predecessors are excluded. The clergy is strictly organized religion with the Emperor acting as the Pontifex Maximus. The major deities have their own organized priesthoods, all under spiritual guidance from the Pontifex Maximus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sabellianist_DESC;Sabellianism is a Local Christian sect of Scholarly soul. A Heretical sect of Christianity founded by Sabellius, whose doctrine states that God is one indivisible being and the forms of Jesus and the Holy Spirit were both outward manifestations of God as he chose to appear to mankind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
saule_DESC;The cult of Saule is an Heretical Baltic Barbarian faith of Clerical soul, with strong Greco-Roman influences. A sun-worshipping cult of the Baltic religions, it is based off the Roman worship of Sol Invictus. Saule, the sun god, is worshipped in a monotheistic fashion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
saura_DESC;The cult of Surya is an Heretical Indian faith of Traditional soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
saura_reformed_DESC;The cult of Surya Brahman is a  Mainstream Indian faith of Statist Soul;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
semipelagian_DESC;Semipelagianism is a Local Christian creed of Clerical soul. It was developed as a compromise between Pelagianism and the teachings of the Church. Pelagianism opposes mainstream Catholicism by stating that mankind is capable of choosing right and wrong without need of divine aid, while Catholicism teaches that man cannot come to God without the grace of God. The Semipelagian compromise states that beginning of faith is free will, but the growth of faith is God's work. This is contrary to the common Catholic belief at the time that the beginning of faith requires an initiative from God, but the rest is free will. Thus, according to Catholicism, no one can merit the initial grace of forgiveness associated with conversion, as Semipelagians attempt to convey. In practice, Semipelagian communities have their own well-structured clergy and their rites have evolved in a distinct way, although they are not as radical as Pelagians in opposing mainstream Catholicism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
serer_reformed_DESC;The Fat Roog ( "Will of Roog" ) is a Reformed Mainstream West African Shamanic religion of Statist soul. It is an organized version of the Serer religious traditions, suitable for doctrinization and proselytization, with a single religious scripture including a creation myth, totem animal fables and chapters on the lesser spirits under Roog. The church also has a standardized liturgy and a formal priestly hierarchy under the ruler, who is seen as the protector of Roog's faith in Earth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
set_DESC;The cult of Set ( or Sutah ) is an Heretical Archaic Egyptian faith of Messianic soul, with strong Saharan influences. The cult is henotheistic in nature, honoring Set, but also focusing on His family, particularly Nephthys, Anat and Astarte ( Who was imported by the Canaanites ), who are the three wives of Set, and Set's son Anubis. Set is viewed as a positive force, a god who brings about change. In their narrative, Set did not murder Osiris but helped him die in order to become the king of the dead just as Set is king of the Gods. As Set is as well a God of Outsiders, there is a number of foreign practices involved, in particular the customs of the Berber tribes of the Sahara. Similarly to other Egyptian faiths, the dead are honored in daily life. They believe in a coming savior, the son of Set, who will restore Egypt to power and drive out the plethora of false gods ruling over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
set_reformed_DESC;The faith of the Deshret ( "Red Land" ) is a Reformed Mainstream Archaic Egyptian faith of Martial soul. This religion is the reformed cult of Set, taking the name "Deshret" after the Red Land, the desert, realm of Set. The cultist have been transformed into an organized and powerful priesthood, headed by an High Priest of Set. As one of his roles is the God of Warriors, Set is the patron of the army, and thus military victories are often attributed and dedicated to him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sethian_DESC;The Sethoitae ("followers of Seth") are a Local Gnostic cult of Traditional soul, with significant Jewish influences. According to the Sethoitae mythos, the material world was created by the demiurge Yaldabaoth, who in turn was a creation of Sophia - an emanation of the Only God's wisdom. Yaldabaoth has created the Earth, assisted by his subordinates - the Archons - and tricked mankind into believing he is the Only God. His greatest creation is Adam and Eve's third son - Seth - who unwittingly inherited divine powers Yaldabaoth had stolen from Sophia. According to Sethians, Jesus of Nazareth was Seth's reincarnation, and his earthly mission was to reunify human souls - particles of Light dispersed in the world - with the divine world called Pleroma. Since the Light is timeless and eternal, Sethians cherish tradition, upholding ceremonies and beliefs described in the scriptures. They are steadfastly orthodox, considering every change as yet another corrupted creation of Yaldabaoth, aimed to retake the divine powers Seth inherited.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sethian_reformed_DESC;The Tertifilian Church is a Reformed Mainstream Gnostic denomination of Statist soul, with strong Jewish influences. They take their name from Seth's position as the Third Son ("Terti Filius") of Adam. The reformation of gnosticism changed the tenets of the religion very little: Seth is still viewed as the savior and Jesus his reincarnation. However, some particularly holy priests are given the distinction of being the 'closest to Seth' and govern religious affairs. May all the Light of the World be one under Seth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shams_DESC;The worship of Shams is a Mainstream Archaic Arabic faith of Clerical soul. It represents the native religious traditions of the Arabic peoples, who venerate the gods of the Sun, the Moon and other Celestial Objects, as well as many other deities, such as patron gods of familiar clans and cities and a plethora of minor Local divinities and spirits. Named after Shams, the Arabic sun goddess at the head of the pantheon, other important gods include Ta'lab the moon god, the goddess triad of Al-lat, al-Uzza and Manat, Wadd the god of water, love and fertility, and 'Attar the god of war and the morning star. Like other native Semitic faiths, it has a strict priesthood composed of both male and female priests, which tend to the temples and perform rites of astrology vital to contact, worship and interpret the will of the gods. Many soothsayers, oracles and astrologers are as well consulted by the common folk to consult the gods for their fortune.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shaytana_DESC;The followers of Shaytana are a Local Greco-Roman cult of Messianic soul, with strong Gnostic influences. The follwers of the Shaytanic faith believe that one day their enlightened patron, Shaytana, will return and continue his work on creating Lux Invicta! Until then, The Custodian Council keep preparing the world for the inevitable return of the Creator of Light. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shiite_DESC;The Shia are a Mainstream Islamic denomination of Messianic soul. It is a major denomination of Islam, differing from Sunni Islam in the belief that caliphates should be led by purified members of Muhammad's direct lineage. Practices also differ, largely in the prayer stone they use (following the belief that prayer should be closer to something naturally from the Earth, rather than a manufactured rug).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
slavic_christian_DESC;Slavic Christianity is a Local Christian creed of Clerical soul, characterized by strong Barbarian influences. Increasing influence of the Solar religions among Slavic peoples motivated the Catholic Church to pay due attention to this group of people emerging as the power broker of the distant eastern lands. The Pope sent twelve clerical envoys with a strong escort and lavish gifts to make their way to the eastern edge of the world for the sake of meeting, impressing, and converting the king of the Slavs. For three years, no news came to Rome from the Papal embassy. Eventually, an Audianist merchant from Caffa brought one of the chests back with the heads of eleven of the envoys. No more was heard from the Slavs for twenty-nine years, until a delegation came presenting themselves as envoys of the Bishop of the Holy Church of the Slavs. How the last of the twelve envoys could succeed is not clear, but a semiautonomous Christian church for the Slavs emerged. It first organized itself underground, without support from any ruler or the rest of Christendom. As a result, the Slavic clerics have started creating am organized clergy of their own, somehow replicating the early Christian days when the Church had to hide from the Roman State.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
slavic_christian_reformed_DESC;The Slavic Church is a Reformed Mainstream Christian denomination of Clerical soul, with strong Barbarian influences. Slavic Christianity's strength has consumed the pagan enemies surrounding it. With no need for underground worship any longer numerous elements of the church Slavic Christianity was derived from seep back in: a religious head - similar to a Pope - and church worship to name a few.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
slavic_pagan_DESC;The Rodnovery ( "Native Faith" ) is a Local Slavic Barbarian faith of Traditional soul. It represents the native religious traditions of the Eastern Slavs, in which Rod is seen as the creator god and therefore the king of the gods, although in some groups, Svarog is worshipped as the principal deity. Other deities include Perun (god of thunder), Veles (god of the underworld), Jarilo (goddess of the moon), Dažbog (god of the sun), and so forth. Rituals include festivals throughout the year, namely seasonal festivals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
slavic_pagan_reformed_DESC;The Slavianist faith is a Reformed Mainstream Slavic Barbarian Religion of Statist soul. In the reformed religion, Rod is given total authority over all other gods which become more akin to saints than divine beings. A codified set of myths frame Rod as the fountain that begets all the gods and all the things existing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_DESC;The cult of Sol Invictus is a Mainstream Greco-Roman religion of Statist soul. Also called Solar-Imperialism, the central figure of this cult is Sol Invictus ("Invincible Sun"), incarnated in flesh as the Imperator of the Imperium Romanum. As such, the Imperator is perceived as a divine figure, having unquestionable authority in every matter, be it secular or spiritual. Since its introduction by Imperator Commodus in the 2nd Century CE, Solar-Imperialism became one of the most widespread and influential religions of the world, influencing religious systems from Britannia and Scandinavia all the way to Ethiopia. Two of the most distinguishing practices of the Sol-Imperial cult are the celebration of the 25th of December (Dies Natalis Sol Invictus - "Day of Invincible Sun's Birth") and the practice of "going into the desert" - a practice in which the aging emperor abdicates the throne in favor of his heir, so that the new Sun would rise once the old one sets. Still, peaceful transitions of power are rather unheard of - with most emperors either slain in battle or murdered by palace plotters, only a few actually left Constantinople to die peacefully in the arid wastelands of the Sahara. The central temple of Sol Invictus - the Hagia Sophia of Constantinople - is the greatest sacral building of the known world, dwarfing even the most majestic Islamic sanctuaries and the tallest Zoroastrian Temples of Fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_apollo_DESC;The cult of Apollo-Helios is a Local Greco-Roman faith of Statist soul. A Hellenistic version of the worship of Sol Invictus, with Apollo being the monotheistic god in focus. Unlike in Solar-Imperialism, followers of Apollo-Helios do not believe any emperor or ruler is Apollo-incarnate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_boreas_DESC;The cult of Apollo-Boreas is a Local Greco-Roman faith of of Statist soul with strong Steppe influences. Apollo-Boreas is the union of Apollo, the sun god, and Boreas, the northern wind god, The Devouring One. Boreas was adopted as a patron by the Bosporan Kings - as a cruel unforgiving God he complements the benevolent side of Apollo - together they form a two-faced God reveling in the duality of good and evil. In the first half of the year, the Apollo facet is venerated for his warmth and the other half, Boreas is offered sacrifices to stave off the cold of winter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_boreas_reformed_DESC;Septentrionism is a Reformed Mainstream Greco-Roman faith of Statist soul, with strong Steppe influences. As the Apollo-Boreasean religion evolved, Boreas was given more and more power at the expense of Apollo. In Septentrionism Boreas has become the god of both good and bad tidings: Apollo is merely a messenger of Boreas's good tidings. Bad tidings are sent by figures like Notus and Zephyrus - the other wind demigods. The North Wind blows fierce and proud!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_christ_DESC;Solar-Christianity is an Heretical Greco-Roman religion of Statist soul, with significant Christian influences. Also called Helianism, it was established in the 4th Century CE and popularized during the reign of Imperator Alexander VII, Solar-Christianity claims that the Christian prophet Jesus of Nazareth is the only true Sun incarnate and the son of God. While it does share basic elements with other Christian creeds, its pagan elements (such as the adaptation of Dies Natalis Sol Invictus as central holiday, or the personality cult of the Imperator as Christ's sole successor) make other Christian creeds treat their Solar brethren with suspicion and caution. While moderate Solar-Christians are usually tolerated by followers of the Invincible Sun, more radical elements tend to openly challenge the authority of the Imperators, seeing them as mere usurpers to Christ, who is to return during the Day of Judgement to purge the Earth of all evil. Solar-Christian monarchs enjoy undisputed authority - which stems from the Solar component, supported by Saint Augustine's theory of Civitas Dei (City of God) - according to which a strong secular state is required to protect the faithful from evil until the Day of Judgement comes and a pure Kingdom of God is created.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_islam_DESC;Al-Shams Islam is a Local Islamic sect of Statist soul, characterized by strong Greco-Roman influences. When Muawiya established control over the lands conquered by the Muslims, he found the wide array of spiritual affiliations present in Judea (the crossroad of empires) both a liability and an opportunity. Challenged by both heathens and the first divisions within Islam, which were encouraged by covert Roman actions, he reacted by blurring the lines of division between all the religions under his control. Making only vague references to Muhammad as the first among a lineage of God's messengers, he controlled tightly the emerging clergy, stopped the codification of Islam into canon holy texts and established himself as the only "Commander of the Faithful." His spiritual message, garbed in typically Roman monarchical allure, combined ambiguously Muhammad's oral legacy with Manichaean and Solar components so as to establish himself as the rallying point of all sects persecuted in the Roman and Sassanid empires, while reuniting the Muslim faithful. Many of his senior advisors were open worshipers of Sol Invictus. Later on, Umayyad caliphs would finally establish a more formal and less tolerant form of Islam. Under the influence of an increasingly powerful clergy, some within the realm of Islam - particularly in the deserts of Palestine around Nabatea where various heretical sects thrived far away from civilization - refused the new orthodox Qur'an and interpretation of the Prophet's life as innovations made up by strangers from the genuine Muslim community to justify their own bide for power. Mu'awiya's offspring, excluded from the palace politics in Damascus but still strong in Nabatea, seized the opportunity and referred to him as both heir of Muhammad  and the reincarnation of Alexandros XV (martyred during the Muslim siege of Alexandria, and whose return was expected by various Solar and Solar-Christian sects). In this double legacy, the true message of the Solar God, as revealed first to Muhammad, was made clear: all the empires of men but the Realm of the Faithful will be brought to dust by the burning wrath of God, and believers should follow the holy lineage stemming from Muawiya. In many aspects, the key beliefs of Al-Shams Muslims appear, to be paradoxically consistent with the Qur'an as codified by their Sunni enemies, but yet they follow a radically different interpretation of the holy text, emphasizing the Solar elements in Allah and his Word, minimizing the importance of Muhammad, refuting all hadith and the location of the Muslim holy cities in Hijaz. Refusing to lay down the Solar God's holy message in writing, they instead worship their Monarch, Son of the Sun, Shadow of God on Earth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_islam_reformed_DESC;The Ahl al-Shamshi ( "People of the Sun" ) are a Reformed Mainstream Islamic denomination of Statist soul, with strong Greco-Roman influences. The vaguely Islamic sect of Muawiya has reformed and has become far more similar to the Imperial Solar religion of the Eastern Roman Empire. The Qur'an is cherrypicked for justification of the heirs of Muawiya, and Muawiya's heirs themselves are seen as reincarnations of Sol Invictus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_mani_DESC;Solar-Manicheaism is a Local Gnostic faith of Statist soul, with strong Persian influences. A hybrid-religion that worships Sol Invictus as the God of Light in Manichaean fashion, fighting against Ahriman, the king of darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_norse_DESC;The worship of Odin-Sol is a Local Norse cult of Statist soul, characterized by strong Greco-Roman influences. Increasing contacts with the Roman Empire by Varangian captains led to a synthesis between the traditional Nordic deity Óðinn with the Roman cult of Sol Invictus. This synthesis makes Óðinn-Sól a patron of rulers, associated with victorious conquests and wise administration alike. The chief attribute of Óðinn-Sól is his single eye, representing the solar disc. It is said that Óðinn sacrificed his other eye to gain infinite wisdom, so that he can shine upon the world for only half of a day. Another chief belief is the so-called Ragnarök ("Twilight of the Gods") when the forces of darkness would rise against the Sun, and the next world would be born anew from the ashes of the previous.

sol_sahara_DESC;The Dulefukan ( "Red Sun" ) cult is a Local Saharan faith of Messianic soul, with strong Greco-Roman influences. This religion belongs to the Fur migrants who settled in the area west of the Nile. Legend has it that while moving in the desert, the early Fur in the area came across pale-skinned men in ornate dress who appeared to be dying of thirst. When provided with aid, they said that they were tasked with escorting the Sun Emperor - whom they called "Sol Invictus" - into the desert as per their servitude to their Lord Made Flesh. They also said that he will return one day to rule forever. Basically, the nomads were fascinated by these strange light-skinned men and believed them to be celestial servants of this Sol Invictus. The men were revered by the tribe and essentially treated comparable to saints. As time and generations went on, light-skinned people became more and more familiar to the Fur and obviously they were no longer thought of as celestial beings, but rather held the place of the first missionaries to the Fur in spreading the will of Sol Invictus, and the initial men that were encountered are still regarded as messengers of Sol Invictus that were meant to be found by the Fur. This religion is not the same as Solar-Imperial because they do not recognize the validity of the current emperor, for they  believe that the true Sun Emperor will return one day, and all others are either imposters or placeholders until his return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

teiwaz_DESC;The worship of Teiwaz is a Local Germanic Barbarian religion of Martial soul. Teiwaz ("Shining One" or “the God”) is the war god of noble battle, law, justice and the original father of the gods and men. Teiwaz, though, is not a god of mindless slaughter in the battlefield, of carnage and base violence, He is the god of war in its glory, courage and heroism. As god of justice and noble battle, it is thought he will only grant victory to those who fight honorably, such as a defensive army that fights for its freedom or simply for survival. The Teiwazic branch of Germanic paganism rose during the chaos of the barbarian invasions in 355 AD, when Germanic armies encountered the disciplined armies of Rome. As large parts of the Germanic hosts were composed by undisciplined and impetuous youths, they made for poor soldiers, thus, the chieftains of various tribes decided to pay Germanic foederati, trained by the Romans, to instruct their warriors in the proper art of war. These foederati, who were veterans of the Comitatenses, also brought with them the cult of Mars, which was quickly related by the Germanic warriors to Teiwaz, the Local god of war and noble battle. With their newfound discipline and skill in the art of war, these Germanic hosts won one battle after another, all of their fair victories attributed to Teiwaz. In those tribes where the worship of Teiwaz became prevalent, the other traditional gods started to wane in importance until they became minor Local spirits or simply ceased to exist. Thus, in Teiwazic mythos, Teiwaz has become the sole ruler of the heavens. The caste of warrior-priests of Teiwaz, who descend mostly from the Germanic foederati who trained the tribes, is charged with training the new generations in the arts of war and presiding over martial rituals, such as ritualistic duels, to maintain discipline amongst the warriors. Teiwaz is symbolized by the sword and many warriors scratch his name in runes on their sword-blades for good luck and bravery during battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

They believe that the blood of their enemies feeds the sky and gives power to Ahriman-Tengri. The most zealous amongst them also believe that "if the sky is a desert, so should the world below be". To do this they conquer it and purge it of all those who would not bow to Ahriman-Tengri.

It is believed that the Enlightened Sky Father knows the ways of attaining a blissful, tranquil state without need or suffering, which he teaches to those who reincarnate in his Sky Realm and the his intermediaries on Earth, the Shamans. The religion emerged gradually from contacts between local religions of steppe peoples and Buddhist missionaries sent by Ashoka, followed by Sogdian and Indohellenic merchants. As early as the 3rd century BC, Ashoka's missionaries were successful in bringing Dhammas to the steppe wizards, after learning their languages, customs and rites. The steppe wizards, not putting aside their ancient beliefs, recognized the wisdom of Buddha's message, associating him with the Supreme Deity Ata Burkhan. The term of "Shamans", from the Sanskrit root "Scha-" (to know), came to designate these  spiritual guides of the steppe nomads who incorporated Buddhism into older beliefs, thus accessing to higher enlightenment as well as social status. The Shamans, wandering among their followers under a holy protection no Khan would dare violating and regularly gathering around holy mounds following divine guidance, are the pillars of Ata Burkhanli tribes and societies. Shamans, people chosen by the gods, are able to temporarily reach the Spirit Worlds, including the Sky Realm, through meditation, offerings, dance, music, fasting and reciting of sutras and prayers to enter a sacred ecstatic trance. From those journeys they bring back words of wisdom and prophecy, as well as great amounts of good karma for those participating in their rituals and supporting them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

unctionist_DESC;Unctionism is Local Christian religion of Statist soul. The Merovingian kings of Francia elevated the sanctity of kingship to the point where the king and a council of the bishops of the realm supplant the role of the Pope.

The Sainte Ampoule was brought to Saint Remi by a dove sent by God for the baptism of Clovis I, the first Frankish king to convert to Christianity.

valentinian_DESC;Valentinianism is a Local Gnostic sect of Scholarly soul, with a strong Christian ascendant.

The Father projected thirty Aeons which joined into 15 syzygies, among them being Sophia (wisdom). Her curiosity and passion led to her fall from the Plemora and the creation of the world and man. Man must now recognize the Father as the true source of divine power in order to achieve gnosis, or knowledge. Only individuals of a spiritual nature (those following the truth revealed by Valentinus) can received the gnosis allowing them to return to the divine Pleroma, while those of a psychic nature (the rest of the Christians) can only attain a lesser form of salvation, and that those of a material nature (non-Christian infidels) are doomed to perish.
