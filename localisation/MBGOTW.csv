DAMO94EVTDESC;Your resentful harpy of a wife, Lady [From.GetFirstName] has decided that marriage to you has become unbearable. Although there will be scandal, and the Church will predictably disapprove, your wife has enough powerful supporters to ensure the divorce is a foregone conclusion. Apparently, you were closer cousins than realized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO100TP;Attempt to take over affairs of state from your wife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO100EVTDESC;My overbearing husband, [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName], has been constantly interfering in the rulership of my lands, and has of late grown beyond the merely opinionated to the worryingly forceful. Already, the garrison of [This.Capital.GetName] has begun to defer to his word over mine. Whatever shall I do? Who could I turn to for support?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO100OPTADESC;I will turn to a capable lover for succor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO100OPTBDESC;A capable member of my family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO100OPTCDESC;A steadfast and faithful councilor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DAMO100OPTFDESC;I will depend on a trusted friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO100OPTGDESC;A rival of my husband's is my last resort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO101EVTDESC;You will put [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] in her proper place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO200EVTDESC;My beloved [From.GetFirstName] has informed me that her domineering husband, [From.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName], is attempting to usurp her rights in [From.Capital.GetName]. She has implored me to somehow put an end to his machinations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO200OPTADESC;My sword, my wits and my heart is yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO200OPTBDESC;He'll never be a problem again, honey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO201EVTDESC;Oh no! My hot-headed lover [From.GetFirstName] has decided to take matters into his own hands in ways I never intended. He's determined to ambush my husband, Lord [This.Spouse.GetFirstName], and it's too late to persuade him otherwise! This could be a disaster...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO201TP;My lover is going to do something rash.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO201OPTADESC;This wasn't what I wanted...Was it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO202EVTDESC;You are out hunting with a few trusted companions, when - suddenly - the forest is filled with the lethal twanging of crossbows firing from hidden locations. You try to spur your horse to safety, but too late, a bolt slams into your ribcage and knocks you from the saddle. The last thing you see is [FromFrom.GetFirstName] gazing down upon with grim satisfaction...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO202TP;[This.GetTitledFirstName] is set upon in the forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO202OPTADESC;He should be no trouble for a little while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO203EVTDESC;A trusted informant has brought word of an impending attempt on your life by a certain [FromFrom.GetFirstName]. You don't know what you have done to earn this man's ire, but he fought fiercely and was seriously wounded when cornered for questioning. He lingers near death in the dungeon, refusing even now to confess his motives...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO203TP;[This.GetTitledFirstName] learns of a dire plot in the nick of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO203OPTADESC;[This.GetTitledFirstName] wept when she heard, no doubt with relief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO204EVTDESC;You ambushed [From.GetTitledFirstName] while he was out riding with only a few trusted companions - all scythed down like wheat by hidden crossbowmen. You could not help but feel a grim satisfaction as you stood over the dying [From.GetFirstName] and watched him breathe his last, knowing he would never threaten your beloved [From.Spouse.GetFirstName] again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO204OPTADESC;I did it only for my sweet [This.GetFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO204OPTBDESC;Now we can truly be together...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO205EVTDESC;You had scarcely finished laying plans to ambush [From.GetTitledFirstName] on the morrow, when the axes of his thugs began reducing your chamber door to kindling. Someone talked! Trapped, you fought desperately before being overwhelmed. Hideously wounded, you have been dragged into the torture chamber...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO205OPTADESC;I will never betray sweet [This.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO206EVTDESC;Your husband, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], has been set upon and murdered in the forest! Although none can prove your exact relationship to the killer, [From.GetFirstName], there is enough of a lingering suspicion to create a serious rift with your late husband's infuriated kinsmen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO206TP; A body is brought in from the forest...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO206OPTADESC;It could have been worse...	couldn't it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO207EVTDESC;Your husband, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], has been set upon and murdered in the forest! Not only is the identity of his killer, [From.GetFirstName], on everyone's lips, but also that he is your lover!

DAMO207TP;[From.GetFirstName] demands your hand in marriage...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO207OPTADESC;How could I have ever trusted him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO208EVTDESC;Somehow, my husband, [This.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName], has learned of [From.GetFirstName]'s plot to destroy him and has struck first. My lover has been horrifically injured and taken to the torture chambers, yet refuses to implicate me. I have no choice but to express relief at my husband's safety and accede to his every desire, lest suspicion fall upon me next...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO208TP;[From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO208OPTADESC;This has gone worse than I ever imagined...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO209EVTDESC;Your gentle mistress, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has implored you to aid her against her boorish husband, [From.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName], who is unfairly infringing upon her rights. You have no choice but to act, as her husband would almost certainly dismiss such a loyal councilor as yourself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO209TP;Your faithful councilor receives an earnest letter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO209OPTADESC;I am ever at your service, mistress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO210EVTDESC;My dear [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has sent me a letter, claiming her boorish husband [From.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] is unfairly infringing upon her rights to govern in [From.Capital.GetName]. She implores you to come and put him in his place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO211EVTDESC;Your worthless [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] sadly regrets that he is unable to help you against your brutish husband. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO212EVTDESC;Your wonderful [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] agrees to come visit you in [Root.Capital.GetName] right away. Although only able to stay for a little while before matters in [From.GetHerHis] own lands require [From.GetHerHis] attention, [From.GetSheHe] leaves behind a cadre of hardened [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] retainers to help keep your husband, [This.Spouse.GetFirstName], in line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO211OPTADESC;Oh no...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO212OPTADESC;Hopefully, this will convince him to not press matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO213EVTDESC;I only stayed in [From.Capital.GetName] for a little while. However, I left a behind a picked cadre of hardened [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] retainers to keep an eye on [From.Spouse.GetFirstName] in my absence. My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is now more secure than ever and has thanked me profusely. Hopefully, this has been enough to prevent any further trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO213OPTADESC;No one pushes around a lady of the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO210OPTADESC;I shall go to [From.Capital.GetName] with a large retinue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO210OPTBDESC;I have only my wits and my sword, yet they are hers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO210OPTCDESC;Your [GetFromRelation] will have to fend for herself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO210TP;An urgent letter is sent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO211TP;Your worthless family will not intervene.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO212TP;Go to assist your [GetFromRelation], [This.GetFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO215TP;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] will regret this one day...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO216TP;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] is adamant about assuming a greater share of responsibility within my dominion...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO219TP;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] had best tread lightly for a little while...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO215EVTDESC;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], a leading scion of your wife's family, the [This.Spouse.GetOnlyDynastyName], is unwilling to interfere on [This.Spouse.GetFirstName]'s behalf. There are no further obstacles to your effective assumption of power in [From.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO215OPTADESC;Smart [FromFrom.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO214EVTDESC;Your courageous [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has little in the way of lands or power, yet has put his sword and wits at your disposal. [From.GetFirstName] has quickly come up with a plan of action to put an end to your boorish husband's ambitious pretensions. [This.Spouse.GetLordLady] [This.Spouse.GetFirstName] will not be pleased...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO214OPTADESC;[From.GetFirstName] decides to solve matters at the point of a sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO214OPTBDESC;[From.GetFirstName] decides that a little gold may go a long way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO214OPTCDESC;[From.GetFirstName] intends to drum up popular support on your behalf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO216EVTDESC;Your lovely lady wife, [From.GetFirstName], has decided important matters of state are perhaps best left in your more capable hands after all. She didn't care much for council meetings, anyways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO217EVTDESC;Your poor [GetFromRelation], [From.GetLordLady] [From.GetFirstName], has been forced to cede control over affairs of state in [From.Capital.GetName] to her domineering husband, [From.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO218EVTDESC;Your noble [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has retained control over affairs of state in [From.Capital.GetName]. Apparently, her odious husband, [From.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName], attempted to seize control and was rebuffed and humiliated. He probably won't try to push his luck again any time soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO217OPTADESC;Oh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO219EVTDESC;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], a leading scion of my wife's family, has paid an unexpected visit to [This.Spouse.GetFirstName] at [From.Capital.GetName]. [FromFrom.GetLordLady] [FromFrom.GetFirstName] did not stay long, yet left behind a score of hardened [This.Spouse.GetOnlyDynastyName] retainers, each fiercely loyal to [This.Spouse.GetFirstName] and taking severe umbrage at any attempts to exclude her from the council chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO219OPTADESC;Clever girl. This is merely a temporary inconvenience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO219OPTBDESC;She thinks some [This.Spouse.GetOnlyDynastyName] pansies can really stop me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO219OPTCDESC;Attempt to subvert them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO219OPTDDESC;Attempt to win them over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO220EVTDESC;After studying my wife's new allies, I sought out the grizzled leader of the [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] men and convinced him to open a cask of wine with me. After several flagons and some subtle coaxing, I had him muttering on about the thankless nature of the [This.Spouse.GetOnlyDynastyName]. At one point he tensed as if with some suspicion, yet I held his gaze evenly and after a moment, he relaxed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO220TP;finding an unexpected ally among your wife's new friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO220OPTADESC;He was in my pocket long before we finished the cask.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO221EVTDESC;After observing my wife's new allies for a couple days, I approached a grizzled veteran of the [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] men and soon got him to drinking with me over a flagon of mulled wine. I thought it was going well until I innocently wondered what his long years of thankless loyalty to the House of [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] had ever earned him. In the blink of an eye, his dirk was at my throat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO221TP;finding a serious beating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO221OPTADESC;I was merely jesting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO222EVTDESC;Although the [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] retainers were initially suspicious and hostile, before long they were unable to reconcile the rumors of your odiousness with the evident fact of your chivalrous nature and impressive stature. They soon realized that [FromFrom.GetLordLady] [FromFrom.GetFirstName] would be much better served by submitting to your manly superiority, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO222TP;inspiring your wife's retainers to accept you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO222OPTADESC;They recognize true nobility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO223EVTDESC;You were determined to show the [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] retainers that you were a superior ruler, in whose hands your wife's dominions would truly be best served. Unfortunately, what you assumed to be a lordly bearing came across to them as laughably arrogant. Soon, they were sniggering behind your back and swaggering about in ridiculing imitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO223TP;eliciting only ridicule from your wife's retainers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO223OPTADESC;Do they not recognize true nobility?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO225EVTDESC;You endured the swaggering and arrogance of your wife's new allies for a few days. Then, one night while they were feasting, you burst into the hall with a dozen hired swords. Unfortunately, they had somehow learned of your intentions, and were ready and waiting. The fighting was murderous, but never truly in doubt. [FromFrom.GetLordLady] [FromFrom.GetFirstName] was horrified, yet reluctantly intervened to save your life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO225TP;successfully ambushing your wife's new retainers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO225OPTADESC;The worst wound was to my pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO224EVTDESC;You endured the swaggering and arrogance of your wife's new allies for a few days. Then, one night while they were feasting and drinking, you burst into the hall with a dozen of your most vicious hired swords. The fighting was murderously brutal, yet surprise was complete, and the victor was never in doubt. [FromFrom.GetLordLady] [FromFrom.GetFirstName] was horrified, yet could do nothing to stop it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO224TP;getting seriously hurt in the fighting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO224OPTADESC;None remain to champion your wife's cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO226EVTDESC;Regrettably, I have been out-maneuvered by my husband, Lord [From.GetFirstName], and any effective champion of my dynasty has either been defeated or driven away. The only practical course remaining to me is to cede power to my husband and bide my time for now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO226TP;Lady [This.Spouse.GetFirstName] hears the good news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO226OPTADESC;I don't have much choice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO227EVTDESC;My unruly husband, Lord [This.Spouse.GetFirstName], attempted to maneuver himself into a greater share of power at my expense. Fortunately, he was prevented from doing so by my loyal adherents. Now that he's been adequately chastened, I doubt he will make another attempt anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO227TP;Lady [This.Spouse.GetFirstName] hears the bad news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO227OPTADESC;I have the whip hand, now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO230EVTDESC;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], a leading partisan of your wife's supporters, has moved more quickly than anticipated to ensure the garrison of [From.Capital.GetName] remains devoted to Lady [This.Spouse.GetFirstName]. As a result, your plans have been temporarily put on hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO230TP;[From.GetFirstName] intimidates [This.GetTitledFirstName] into backing off!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO230OPTADESC;This is only a temporary setback.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO231EVTDESC;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], a leading partisan of your wife's supporters, attempted to turn the garrison of [From.Capital.GetName] against your ambitions. He failed and was hounded from the city. With this loss, Lady [This.Spouse.GetFirstName] has bowed to the inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO231TP;[From.GetFirstName] is ambushed by [This.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO231OPTADESC;There is no one else to champion her cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO232EVTDESC;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], a leading partisan of your wife's supporters, has shamelessly ensured the council's support for Lady [This.Spouse.GetFirstName] through a combination of bribery and blackmail. Without their support it will be impossible to exercise any real authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO232TP;[From.GetFirstName] succeeds in bribing a key member of the council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO232OPTADESC;I should have offered more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO233EVTDESC;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], a leading partisan of your wife's supporters, attempted to bribe key members of the court at [From.Capital.GetName] to work against you. Fortunately, you soon learned of this and countered his silver with gold. The council is yours, and Lady [This.Spouse.GetFirstName] has bowed to the inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO233TP;[From.GetFirstName] fails to secure the necessary support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO233OPTADESC;There is no one left to contest my rightful prerogatives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO234EVTDESC;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], a leading partisan of your wife's supporters, has shamelessly stirred up the rabble of [From.Capital.GetName] to a show of popular support for your wife. In the face of such widespread antipathy towards your ambitions, you have no choice but to temporarily desist from forcing the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO234TP;[From.GetFirstName] has managed to stir up popular support against [This.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO234OPTADESC;Damned rabble!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO235EVTDESC;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], a leading partisan of your wife's supporters, attempted to drum up popular support for Lady [This.Spouse.GetFirstName] among the peasantry and townsfolk. He didn't reckon with your own popularity, and barely escaped being torn apart by a mob of your loyal adherents!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO235TP;[From.GetFirstName] has failed to inspire much opposition to [This.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAMO235OPTADESC;There is no one left to contest my rightful prerogatives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
