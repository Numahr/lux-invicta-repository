druid_desc;The Druid's knowledge of the ancient Celtic ballads and of sacred traditions is great and their power among the Celts is without equal. They are responsible for organizing worship and sacrifices, divination, and judicial procedure in Celtic society;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCancrel.0152;I have searched far and wide for a worthy Druid to serve at my court. He will organize worship and sacrifices, divination, and judicial procedure, encourage my warriors, and provide me counsel. At long last, one such man has arrived at my court, but I am not sure whether he is worthy... A ruler must choose his Druid wisely, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAancrel.0152;Let us meet, then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAancrel.0245;Let us meet, then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCancrel.0246;A lord must choose his Druid with care, for while all druids are wise, not all have specialized in the same teachings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCancrel.0153;The people of your court are incredulous. “Great [Root.GetTitle], it is a shame that you do not have a Druid at court! Are you to be like a Bard without his voice, a warrior without his spear, a farmer without his seeds?” No self-respecting ruler of the islands can go without a Druid, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAancrel.0153;I must find a knowledgeable Druid, and fast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

title_court_bard_desc;Bards were those who sang the songs recalling the tribal warriors' deeds of bravery as well as the genealogies and family histories of the ruling strata among Celtic societies. The Celtic peoples maintain an intricate oral history committed to memory and transmitted by bards. Bards facilitated the memorization of such materials by the use of meter, rhyme and other formulaic poetic devices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0154.desc;Typically my Bard only provides performances to a select few at my court, entertaining us with stories, histories, jokes, and more. It is time that I organize something on a grander scale for the entire community. As a display of my capacity as [Root.GetTitle], I shall host a great performance led by my Bard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0154.a;Let me tell my Bard my thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0177.tooltip;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] discusses [Root.GetHerHis] plan with [Root.GetHerHis] Bard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0177.desc;“A good idea,” my Bard says, as we discuss my plan. “I will make preparations as soon as I can. You too, my liege, do your part in organizing this. Let the community know of your generosity!”\n”What sort of things are you planning to do?” I ask my Bard. “You must do many things - praise my ancestors, entertain the people, recall histories and great legends...”\n”Worry not,” my Bard says. “I think I have a good idea of what to do for this year’s performance. Just wait and see, my liege - as always, I will not disappoint. You and the community will be very much entertained. It will only be a matter of time.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0177.name;Preparing and Organizing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0177.a;I can hardly wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0171.desc;Your Bard has already given many wonderful performances! You and your audience are eager to hear more. Will your Bard tell of your ancestors’ heroic deeds next? Or maybe he’ll recount another adventure of the lazy genius Ouati and the ever-curious Kadi? Or perhaps he’ll start teasing some more people?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0171.a;Let us hear more, my Bard, let us hear more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0172.desc;What another wonderful series of performances by your Bard - it’s too bad these sort of large performances only happen every now and then. Everyone is amazed at how your Bard is able to spend hours on end recalling histories and legends, comedies and adventures, all from memory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0172.a;Maybe next time I can hear another story about...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0155.desc;Today my Bard sings of my ancestors’ heroic exploits. Look as he strums his kora harp! But his voice falters - is he tired? One of the audience members interrupts and makes some helpful criticism, as is custom among our people: “Perhaps your rhythm is too fast, respected Bard.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0155.a;Indeed, I agree. Sing slowly - we wish to ponder all you say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0155.b;No, I think his rhythm is fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0155.c;No, be livelier! Imagine what my ancestor felt hunting elephants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0156.desc;“The Hunters approached Chief Nuh, and wished an audience,” your Bard sings, as he continues his story. “But the Chief disagreed. ‘Nay,’ cried he, ‘I shall not meet with these beggars and scavengers.’” Someone in the audience cries, “What a fool Nuh is! To reject the mighty, nyama-wielding hunters!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0156.a;The hunters are powerful like Bards and Blacksmiths indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0156.b;If I remember this story right, Chief Nuh has a good reason for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0157.desc;“[Root.GetTitledFirstName]’s ancestor had to be careful as he snuck in the house, for though the wicked merchant was fat from all the food he ate, he was still sly like a hyena, and could hear even the smallest of sounds,” says your Bard, as he recounts a tale to your court. “But the wicked merchant had to be taught a lesson. Fate was on the side of [Root.GetTitledFirstName]’s ancestor. Though his cunning, he stole all of the wicked merchant’s baklava.”\nYour audience claps and cheers. Very good! That wicked merchant had it coming. So your Bard continues, “On eating one, [Root.GetTitledFirstName]’s ancestor remarked, ‘Wondrous is this delicacy eaten by the Greeks, heirs of Alexander the Great! A pity the wicked merchant had no recipes to steal!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0157.name;The Wicked Merchant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0157.a;Bravo, bravo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0157.b;I wish my ancestor could have stolen the recipe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0158.desc;“How many piled-up ruins! But all the deeds I have spoken of today took place long ago. [Root.GetTitle]s have succeeded [Root.GetTitle]s, but the land has always remained the same. So it was, so it is, and so it will be.” With that, your Bard concludes his story for the day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0158.a;A good tale! Tomorrow, why don’t you tell the story about...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0159.desc;“But [Root.GetTitledFirstName]’s father was brave, and mighty, and though his companions fled, he did not retreat when the lion came. He raised his spear, for he was ready to fight the lion. Then...” Your Bard pauses for dramatic effect, as everyone imagines the lion and your father circling each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0159.a;And then? And then? What happens next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0159.b;Wait a moment... my father never told me about this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0159.c;My father didn’t kill lions, my Bard is making it all up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0160.desc;“And Guimba the Tyrant died, the victim of the trap and his own hubris,” your Bard sings, ending the story. “Thus it is so, that tyrants will always fall, defeated by righteous men who follow the wisdom of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. This is nothing but fate, for who can deny fate? One cannot change it.”\nYour Bard looks up, smiling, as he pauses for a moment. He then resumes playing his kora harp. “The universe has mysteries which none can fathom, even us Bards. Perhaps you will be born a great and mighty king - you can do nothing about it. Perhaps you will be unlucky and become a beggar - you can do nothing about it. Each man finds his way already marked for him and he can change nothing of it.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0160.name;Fate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0160.a;Fate is quite a powerful thing indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0160.b;Fate is a silly idea used to scare children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0161.desc;Today your Bard recounts your entire genealogy, to remind your court of the great men and women from which you descend. It is amazing, is it not, that your Bard knows so much about so many people who lived long ago? Even you learn new things about your ancestors now and then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0161.a;Amazing indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x	
ancrel.0161.b;I bet my Bard made some of that up and made it sound convincing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0161.c;Actually, my Bard, you made a mistake about my great-great-great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0162.desc;“The lad Ouati was a clever genius despite his laziness, always impressing the excitable, ever-curious lass Kadi with his mind,” your Bard sings, as he begins his performance. “Today, if you wish, I will tell of the two. Today, I will tell of how they and their friends solved another mystery in their village, the mystery of the iced cream...”\n”No, no,” one of your audience members interrupt, as is typical custom, “Tell us the one when the sorceress Nemiss tricked Ouati into doing her bidding!” Yet another member of your court, a scholarly sort, speaks his opinion, “I want to hear the one where Ouati and his friends debate about the mysteries of anger.” One more person speaks out, saying, “Those stories aren’t as exciting as the one with the Persian siblings and the bristle toothbrush!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0162.name;Ouati and Kadi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0162.a;So many choices. Good thing my Bard can tell them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0163.desc;“‘I’m curious at what you’re thinking,’ said the lass Kadi, as the lad Ouati tried to figure out a way to escape the trap,” your Bard tells, continuing the story. “‘How will we escape these lions?’” You don’t know how, but in your heart you know the lazy genius Ouati always figures out a way out of the situation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0163.a;I’m curious too! What’s his ingenious solution this time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0163.b;Ha, I’ve already figured this one, Ouati will use Kadi’s headscarf to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0164.desc;“‘...where my evil is law. Now the fool seeks to return to the past and undo the future that is Abubakari!’” your Bard sings in the melodramatic voice of the evil, shapeshifting sorcerer-king Abubakari. Indeed, you wonder, how will the warrior Soumaoro Yaqub undo Abubakari’s evil rule? Surely, the great villain Abu - as everyone calls him - is more than a mere sorcerer - he is a god, in a way.\nAs your Bard continues playing the song of Soumaoro Yaqub on his kora harp, you and your audience can’t wait to hear more of Soumaoro Yaqub’s endless quest to defeat the evil Abu. You’ve heard most of the stories about Soumaoro Yaqub, but you always enjoy hearing them again. Will your Bard tell of when the monkeys taught Yaqub learned to jump well? Or when Yaqub assisted the 300 Greek warriors against the Cattle-men?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0164.name;The Evil that is Abu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0164.a;How about the one when Yaqub lost all his clothes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0165.desc;The audience roars with laughter as your Bard mimics your style of speech and movement during his performance. You can only grimace or do a weak laugh, for you know that the Bards have the right to mock and insult anyone, including their patron, even if that patron is a powerful [Root.GetTitle] like yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0165.a;Ah, well, it’s not that bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0165.b;Fools! You’ll all pay for this... somehow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0165.c;Oh no, let me show you how you should do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0166.desc;“There lies a fabled land far, far away,” your Bard says in a low-tone, powerful and suspenseful. “This is a fearsome, barren land, where the fabled one-legged, one-eyed men live, they who are heathen cannibals! Today, the warrior Soumaoro Yaqub, in his quest to defeat the evil Abubakari, travels there...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0166.a;Will Soumaoro Yaqub undo Abubakari’s evil again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0166.b;Any scholar knows one-legged men live south of us, and they aren’t cannibals!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0167.desc;Today your Bard tells one of the comedic adventures of the perverted youth, Ali-Ali, who is always a lecher around pretty girls. But Ali-Ali also possesses some magical powers, being a sorcerer-in-training, so he always has to fight strange monstrosities terrorizing his village.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0167.a;Is he facing the evil crab again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0168.desc;“There once was a bandit named Ridwan the Red,” your Bard sings, beginning his performance for the day, “who came riding to Oualata from old Timbuktu, and the braggart did swagger and brandish his spear, as he told of bold battles and gold he had stole...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0168.a;Who’s going to humiliate that braggart this time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0169.desc;“There was a land far, far away, that was once threatened by a flying menace,” your Bard says, as he recounts yet another tale. “The flying monsters were great and many, like a swarm of locusts - who would, who could, kill them all? None, until came the once-imprisoned, saintly Kibu’u...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0169.a;Tell us more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0169.b;Bah, I’ve heard other Bards sing the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0170.desc;“You’ve solved this mystery and helped me much,’ the sorceress Namiss said, congratulating the lad Ouati, that lazy genius,” as your Bard continues his tale. But your audience is incredulous. One of your courtiers says, confused, “That makes no sense, that can’t be the ending, and Ouati... isn’t Namiss - “;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0170.a;Something is not right here... this story might not be over just yet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0170.b;Wait, I’ve heard this one before - the fools don’t see a plot twist coming!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0173.desc;What comedic adventures will Ali-Ali go through today? You listen eagerly as your Bard begins to tell another tale of the perverted young sorcerer, Ali-Ali.\n“The clever little snail goddess, Nana, greeted our hero the lusty Ali-Ali. ‘I greet you, Ali-Ali-Ali!’ she said mischievously to her friend,” your Bard sings. “‘My name is not Ali-Ali-Ali!’ said Ali-Ali, ‘It is Ali-Ali!’ To which Nana replied, ‘Sorry, I stuttered!’ And Ali-Ali said, ‘Do you mean it wasn’t on purpose? You! You silly snail! Don’t make me do something nasty!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0173.name;Ali-Ali? Or Ali-Ali-Ali?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0173.a;Wait, is it Arabi-Ali... Al-Hajj-Ali... Ali-Ali-Ali-Ali?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0173.b;I’d like to eat some snail now that my Bard mentions it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0173.c;I definitely know what Ali-Ali means by “nasty.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0174.desc;“[Root.GetTitledFirstName] is just , is [Root.GetSheHe] not? [Root.GetTitledFirstName] is kind, is [Root.GetSheHe] not? [Root.GetTitledFirstName] is mighty, is [Root.GetSheHe] not?” Your Bard sings as he plays his kora harp, the audience watching with rapt attention. “Indeed our [Root.GetTitle] is great, is [Root.GetSheHe] not?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0174.a;Very good, very good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0174.b;No, this praise is too much...  I have faults too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0174.c;This is not enough praise - speak of my other strengths!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0174.d;I can’t believe the audience listens to and believes this nonsense about me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0175.desc;As part of his performance, your Bard steps back and forth solemnly as he chants praises to the ancestors of your clan. There is something dignified yet eerie about him as he marches around. “In the beginning was the Word,” your Bard once told you, “And then Music. Like smiths who learned to create and destroy through tools, so too did we Bards learn to create and destroy through Word, and through Music.”\nSuddenly, a child in your court runs out towards the Bard. You grab the boy and pull him back. “Be careful!” you whisper in a harsh tone. “Do you know who that is? Did your parents tell you nothing? If you cross the path of the Bards, you may die! If they touch you, and they wish it, you may die!” This is no superstition - in your heart, you know this to be true. The Bard is truly a fearsome being who possesses great power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0175.name;The Bard's Power;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0175.a;Even a [Root.GetTitle] such as myself must be careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0175.b;Even for all my skepticism, I cannot be skeptical of the Bard’s power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0176.desc;Today, your Bard will take some time to tell fanciful tales to the children at your court. As you stand nearby, you can’t help but smile a bit as you recall your own childhood, and how your father’s Bard used to tell you exciting tales about the gods and heroes of your people.\n“What story should I tell?” your Bard asks, speaking to his audience, mostly children. “What of the trickster, Anansi the spider, who taught people how to weave cloth? Or how about the clever but lazy Ouati, who can solve any problem? Or what of the great warrior Soumaoro Yaqub, who seeks to undo the evil that is Abubakari?” The children all shout in chaotic disunion, as they demand to hear their favorite stories. You laugh a bit - you were once like that too, no?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0176.name;Children's Stories;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0176.a;As long as my Bard doesn't sing about Ali-Ali the lusty sorcerer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0178.desc;As your Bard finishes yet another performance, the memory of all he has told us these past few days still rings fresh in your mind. Who knew the young sorcerer Ali-Ali could be so lustful, to scavenge after the dirty clothes of young maidens? Who knew my grandfather actually wrestled with five elephants? Who knew how the lazy genius Ouati got out of trouble yet again? And who knew I had so many good qualities?\nYour Bard knew all this. He once said, “My word is pure and free of untruth. It is the word of my father, his father, and his father, and so on as far back as anyone can remember.”\nYes. It must be so. It must have been since time immemorial. So you remember your Bard’s words, “Bards do not know what lying is.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0178.name;Knowing Everything;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0178.a;But for now, I should pay full attention to my Bard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0179.desc;The trickster spirits are always a good topic for the Bards to talk about. Their stories are always full of mischievousness, perfect for all audiences. And so it is that your Bard tells about one such trickster today.\n”One day the trickster Takoi wore a hat, white on one side and red the other,” your Bard sings. “As he walked down the road, some people said his hat was white, but others said it was red. The people began to bicker about the color. White! Red! Red! White! They got so angry, they began to fight and hurt each other. Seeing this, Takoi laughed, exclaiming, ‘People will fight over anything!’”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0179.name;The Trickster;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0179.a;Ha, what silly people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0179.b;People tend to be like this all the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0180.desc;Your Bard continues, “The hero Soumaoro Yaqub came across a strange man from Frangistan, a one-legged warrior wielding a large sword - “\n”The man shouldn’t be from Frangistan,” one of your courtiers interrupts. He suggests something else, as is custom, “I think he should be a Persian!”\n “Make him a Roman! From Constantinople! Romans are amazing,” says another member of the audience.\n”Whoever likes the decadent Romans are imbeciles,” cuts in another person, “The warrior should be from mystical Cathay!”\nAs the audience continues arguing, you see your Bard looks rather confused.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0180.name;From Where?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0180.a;Ignore the fools, choose whatever you want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0180.b;I think the warrior should come from...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0181.desc;“And you,” your Bard sings, looking at one of your courtiers, “the people say you eat too much, and your feces are of many colors - yellow, blue, red, green, purple!”\nThe audience laughs as your gluttonous courtier blushes in embarrassment. “And you,” the Bard sings, continuing his tirade of mockery, “You there, the people say you are a lech, like the young sorcerer Ali-Ali was - but you are three times his age. What are you doing, chasing your granddaughter’s friends, dirty old man?”\nAnd now the Bard turns to yet another person. “And you, ah, you. The people say...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0181.name;And You, And You;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0181.a;Don’t you dare insult me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0181.b;My Bard, talk about my flaws too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0181.c;Talk of my children, that they learn from their flaws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0182.desc;“Of whose ancestors should I speak?” your Bard shouts, “Should I speak of your lineage of leatherworkers, Bonga? For I knew your grandfather well, he was a hard-working man. Or, perhaps, I should tell of your mighty lineage of hunters, Kassa?”\nA few members of the audience make their suggestions, before your Bard decides. “Very well! Listen then to my word, for I will tell you of the ancestors of the jeweler Sakoura. They are brave men, this lineage, who show their strength not through force of arms like warriors or hunters, but through their craft and through their shrewdness. Let me tell of how Sakoura’s great-grandfather Fodi foiled the evil Tuareg chief Ilyas with his wits, with nothing but some Greek pastries and some silver rings...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0182.name;Whose Ancestor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0182.a;Now this sounds like a good story...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0183.tooltip;Preparations for the performance are made - everybody can't wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0183.desc;The day of the performance has dawned. Your Bard, dressed in his finest attire, holds in his hand a kora harp - the sweet, delicate, yet powerful instrument of the Bards - as he presents himself before the community. What sort of stories will he tell? What sort of people will he mock? What ancestors will he honor? For the next few days, you and the community will bear witness to these, and more, perhaps for hours on end.\nIt is custom among the peoples of the savanna that the audience can make suggestions (or even constructive criticisms) to the Bard throughout his performance. Since you are the highest-ranked member of the community present, your Bard allows you to make a suggestion first. “What would I like to hear?” you think to yourself. There are so many things to hear of - too many, for the Bards know much. So many choices indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0183.name;The Show Begins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.0183.a;I think we should start with the story about...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCancrel.0185;An old man has arrived, dressed in the garbs of a druid, he is here to take your child with him to a sacred grove deep inside the forest.\nThere [From.GetSheHe] will be taught the secret arts of the druids, this training will take many years and novices have been known to come back changed, or worse... dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAancrel.0185;Be safe my child;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCancrel.0187;Your child has expressed a peculiar wish, unsatisfied with the life of a warrior, [From.GetSheHe] wishes to learn the druidic arts and become closer to the gods. \nBut that way is strange and dangerous, not all survive it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAancrel.0187;I will not allow it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBancrel.0187;Yes, this will bring great honor to our family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCancrel.0189;The night is dark and cold when your servants wake you, a visitor has come to see you. Suddenly, a black shape pushes them to the side and approaches your bedside, you reach for your sword but slowly realize who it is, [From.GetTitledFirstName], back from the forests of the druids!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAancrel.0189;[From.GetFirstName]! You've... changed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCancrel.0191;On of the supplicants at your court today is hopping on one leg, trying to keep [From.GetHerHis] balance with the help of a knotted stick of wood. [From.GetSheHe] has a familiar look and as [From.GetSheHe] approaches your throne, you finally understand why, it is [From.GetTitledFirstName], back from the druids!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAancrel.0191;My child, what have the gods done to you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCancrel.0193;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is back from the druidic groves, there he has learned much of the ways of the gods and our people, he has sung numerous stories and even come up with a few of his own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCancrel.0195;« My lord!, says own of your guards, a madman is dancing on the roof of the stables, we tried to get him down, but he just screams gibberish at us!» \n You follow your guards to the courtyard and soon understand that the madman is in fact,[From.GetTitledFirstName], struck mad by the gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
