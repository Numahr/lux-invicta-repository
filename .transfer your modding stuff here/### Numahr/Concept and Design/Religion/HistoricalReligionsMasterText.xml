			<Text>Roman Catholicism refers to the theology and doctrine of the Christian church under the auspices of the Holy See, the papacy based in Rome. According to ecclesiastical scholars, Catholicism is distinguished from other branches of Christianity by its commitment to the church's traditions, to the sacraments, and its priesthood as interpreters of the Bible.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The earliest known use of the term "Catholic Church" is by Ignatius of Antioch around 107 AD. The early church was organized based on the rule of three patriarchs, those of Rome, Alexandria and Antioch - to which were later added the patriarchs of Constantinople and Jerusalem. The patriarch of Rome claimed special authority based on the connection between St. Peter and the city. For 1000 years, Roman Catholicism dominated Europe, until the Great Schism of 1054 AD that gave rise to Eastern Orthodoxy. Some 500 years later another major division in Christianity occurred with the Protestant Reformation, which saw many in Europe reject the teachings and practices of Catholicism in favor of more personal expressions of belief.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Presently, the Roman Catholic Church considers those not in communion with the Vatican to be "non-Catholics" but tolerates differing interpretations of the Bible. Roman Catholicism remains the largest Christian church, with over a billion members worldwide.</Text>

			<Text>The first major doctrinal dispute after Constantine recognized Christianity as the state church in AD 313, Arianism occupies an important place in ecclesiastical history.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]First proposed early in the 4th century by the Alexandrian presbyter Arius, Arianism affirmed a nontrinitarian theology in which Christ was not truly divine but a created being. Arius's basic premise was the uniqueness of God, who alone is self-existent and immutable. Because the Godhead is unique and immutable, the Son must be considered a finite being who has been called into existence out of nothing and has had a beginning. According to its opponents, especially the bishop Athanasius, Arius's teaching reduced the Son to a demigod, reintroduced polytheism (since worship of the Son was not abandoned), and undermined the Christian concept of redemption since only he who was truly God could be deemed to have reconciled man to the Godhead.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Thanks largely to the efforts of the Wulfila, a bishop of Arian views who was sent from Constantinople in 341, Arianism spread to the continental German and Gothic tribes and became the state religion of the Visigoths until 587 when Reccared I renounced Arianism in favor of Catholicism.</Text>

			<Text>The Assyrian Church of the East is a Syriac Church historically centered in Assyria, northern Mesopotamia. It is one of the churches that claim continuity with the historical Patriarchate of Seleucia-Ctesiphon; the Church of the East. Unlike most other churches that trace their origins to antiquity, the modern Assyrian Church of the East is not in communion with any other churches, either Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, or Catholic. It represents one of the oldest and longest lasting splits in historic Christianity, following the Christological controversy over Nestorianism in AD 431.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Nestorianism emphasized the disunion between the human and divine natures of Jesus; however, the theology of the Church of the East is not strictly dyophysite. The Church of the East has its roots in the Antiochene theological tradition of the early Church, founded by Diodorus of Tarsus and Theodore of Mopsuestia. Antiochene theology emphasised Christ's humanity and the reality of the moral choices he faced. In order to preserve the impassibility of Christ's Divine Nature, the unity of his person was defined in a looser fashion than in the Alexandrian tradition.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Church of the East developed from the early Assyrian Christian communities in the Assuristan province (Parthian ruled Assyria) of the Parthian Empire, and at its height had spread from its Mesopotamian heartland to as far as China, Central Asia, and India. A dispute over patriarchal succession led to the Schism of 1552, resulting in there being two rival Patriarchs. One of the factions that eventually emerged, the Chaldean Catholic Church, eventually re-entered into communion with the Catholic Church.</Text>

			<Text>Oriental Orthodoxy is the faith of those Eastern Christian Churches that recognize only the first three ecumenical councils; the First Council of Nicaea, the First Council of Constantinople, and the First Council of Ephesus. Despite the potentially confusing nomenclature, Oriental Orthodox churches are distinct from those that are collectively referred to as the Eastern Orthodox Church.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Formally, Oriental Orthodoxy split from Roman Catholicism in AD 451 with the rejection of the Council of Chalcedon. As one of the earliest Oriental Orthodox churches, the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria usually retains the symbolic position of "first among equals" similar to the Ecumenical Patriarch among the Eastern Orthodox. The Oriental Orthodox communion comprises six churches: Coptic Orthodox, Ethiopian Orthodox, Eritrean Orthodox, Syriac Orthodox, Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, and Armenian Apostolic churches. These churches, while being in communion with one another, are hierarchically independent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Oriental Orthodox Churches and the rest of the Church split over differences in Christological terminology. The First Council of Nicaea declared that Jesus Christ is God, that is to say, consubstantial with the Father; and the First Council of Ephesus that Jesus, though divine as well as human, is only one being. Twenty years after Ephesus, the Council of Chalcedon declared that Jesus is one person in two complete natures, one human and one divine. Those who opposed Chalcedon likened its doctrine to the Nestorian heresy, condemned at Ephesus, that Christ was two distinct beings, one divine (the Logos) and one human (Jesus).</Text>

			<Text>The Eastern Orthodox Church is currently the second-largest Christian denomination, with an estimated 300 million adherents. The goal of Orthodox Christians is to draw nearer to God throughout their lives through theosis, a spiritual pilgrimage to become more "Christ-like."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The church traces its roots to the Great Schism. During the 9th and 10th centuries AD the Christian church under the Patriarch of Constantinople made significant conversions among the peoples of eastern Europe, including Kievan Russia and the Balkans. Doctrinal issues such as the filioque split and the authority of the Pope over the Patriarch in matters religious, exacerbated by the political and economic rivalry of Rome and Constantinople, led to a schism. The final breach between these two branches of Christianity is acknowledged as the sacking of Constantinople by the Catholic crusaders in 1204 AD. Moreover, after the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453, the Eastern Church became even more isolated from Rome under the relatively tolerant rule of the Turks.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Orthodox Church, which saw itself as the true heir to the teachings and practices of the early Christians, flourished under the Russian Tsars. Although somewhat diminished by Communist rule and Balkan secularism, Eastern Orthodoxy has experienced a resurgence in recent decades and remains a vital aspect of Christianity.</Text>

			<Text>Bogomilism was a dualist religious sect that flourished in the Balkans between the tenth and fifteenth centuries. It arose in Bulgaria toward the middle of the tenth century from a fusion of dualistic, neo-Manichaean doctrines imported especially from the Paulicians, a sect of Armenia and Asia Minor, and a local Slavic movement aimed at reforming the recently established Bulgarian Orthodox Church. The Bogomils were so called after their founder, the priest Bogomil.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Bogomils rejected the dominant Eastern Christian church and its hierarchy, temples, sacraments, and ceremonies. They replaced these with simple prayers accompanied by ritual meals. The Bogomils did not recognize the Old Testament or the veneration of the cross, saints, or relics. At the basis of the religious and philosophical doctrine of Bogomilism stood the concept of the duality of the world and of the eternal struggle between good and evil principles. They held that the earthly world and the flesh were creations of the devil, whereas the celestial world and the spirit were manifestations of good.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Bogomils taught that prayers were to be said in private houses, not in separate buildings such as churches. Ordination to the status of elder was conferred by the congregation and not by any specially appointed minister. The congregation were the "elect", and each member could obtain the perfection of Christ. However, within the Bogomil communities there was a distinction between the "perfect", who lived ascetic lives and renounced marriage, and the ordinary people.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Bogomilism was eradicated in Bulgaria and Byzantium in the thirteenth century, but survived in Bosnia and Herzegovina until the Ottoman Empire gained control of the region in 1463. Both Catholics and Orthodox persecuted the Bogomils as heretics.</Text>

			<Text>Cathari ("pure") was a name most notably used as a designation for a group of dualistic sects of the later Middle Ages that thrived throughout Southern Europe, particularly northern Italy and southern France, between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries. The Cathari professed a neo-Manichaean dualism; that there are two principles, one good and the other evil, and that the material world is evil.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although the various groups emphasized different doctrines, they all agreed that matter was evil. Man was an alien and a sojourner in an evil world; his aim must be to free his spirit, which was in its nature good, and restore it to communion with God. There were strict rules for fasting, including the total prohibition of meat. Sexual intercourse was forbidden; complete ascetic renunciation of the world was called for.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Cathar doctrines of creation led them to rewrite the biblical story, and they devised an elaborate mythology to replace it. They viewed much of the Old Testament with reserve; some of them rejected it altogether. The orthodox doctrine of the Incarnation was rejected. Jesus was merely an angel, and his human suffering and death were an illusion. They also severely criticized the worldliness and corruption of the Catholic Church.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Under constant persecution by the Catholic Church, the Cathar hierarchy faded out in the 1270s. The heresy lingered through the fourteenth century and finally disappeared early in the fifteenth.</Text>

			<Text>The Hussites were followers of the Bohemian religious reformer Jan Hus; the best known representative of the Bohemian Reformation and one of the forerunners of the Protestant Reformation. Hus was condemned by the Council of Constance and burned at the stake in 1415. Hussitism, which organized after Hus's death, was predominantly a religious movement propelled by social issues and which helped to strengthen Czech national awareness.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Hussite movement can be divided into two factions. The moderate party, who followed Hus more closely, sought to conduct reform while leaving the whole hierarchical and liturgical order of the Church untouched. However, they broke with Rome in using a Czech liturgy and in administering Holy Communion to the laity under the forms of both bread and wine. The more radical Hussites identified themselves more boldly with the doctrines of John Wycliffe and his desire to return the Church to an apolostic state. This required the removal of Church hierarchy and a rejection of everything that they believed had no basis in the Bible. The primary distinction from the more moderate party was their denial of transubstantiation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The movement climaxed during the Hussite Wars (1419-1434) between the Hussites and various monarchs who sought to enforce the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. The Hussite community included most of the Czech population of the Kingdom of Bohemia, and formed a major military power. Although association with the Roman Catholic Church continued, the moderate Hussites survived schisms and periodic persecutions until 1620 when they were finally absorbed by Rome. However, Hussite theology continued in the "Unitas Fratrum" movement and eventually the Moravian Church.</Text>

			<Text>Anglicanism is one of the major branches of the 16th-century Protestant Reformation and a form of Christianity that includes features of both Protestantism and Roman Catholicism. Anglicanism is loosely organized in the Anglican Communion, a worldwide family of religious bodies that represents the offspring of the Church of England and recognizes the archbishop of Canterbury as its nominal head. It prizes traditional worship and structure but operates autonomously and flexibly in different locales.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although the Anglican Communion has a creed, the Thirty-nine Articles, it has been disposed to allow widely divergent interpretations. Thus, Anglicans see themselves as possessing a cluster of historic pieties and procedural loyalties but few firm rules. The Book of Common Prayer, a compilation of the church's liturgical forms originally issued in 1549, represents the faith's independence from Rome and remains the hallmark of Anglican identity. The prayer book derives from ancient English spirituality and embodies the uniqueness of Anglican Christianity.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With a membership estimated at around 80 million members the Anglican Communion is the third largest Christian communion in the world, after the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Churches.</Text>

			<Text>Lutheranism is a branch of Christianity that traces its interpretation of the Christian religion to the teachings of Martin Luther and the 16th-century movements that issued from his reforms. Along with Anglicanism, the Reformed and Presbyterian (Calvinist) churches, Methodism, and the Baptist churches, Lutheranism is one of the five major branches of Protestantism. Unlike the Roman Catholic Church, however, Lutheranism is not a single entity. It is organized in autonomous regional or national churches, such as the Church of Sweden or the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Mecklenburg. Globally, there are some 140 such Lutheran church bodies; 138 of these are loosely joined in the Lutheran World Federation, which was established in 1947. At the beginning of the 21st century, there were more than 65 million Lutherans worldwide, making Lutheranism the second largest Protestant denomination, after the Baptist churches.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Theologically, Lutheranism embraces the standard affirmations of classic Protestantism: the repudiation of papal and ecclesiastical authority in favour of the Bible (sola Scriptura), the rejection of five of the traditional seven sacraments affirmed by the Catholic Church, and the insistence that human reconciliation with God is effected solely by divine grace (sola gratia), which is appropriated solely by faith (sola fide), in contrast to the notion of a convergence of human effort and divine grace in the process of salvation.</Text>

			<Text>The Reformed and Presbyterian churches refer to various Protestant churches that share a common origin in the Reformation of 16th-century Switzerland. Reformed is the term identifying churches regarded as essentially Calvinistic in doctrine. The term Presbyterian designates a collegial type of church government by pastors and by lay leaders called elders, or presbyters, from the New Testament term "presbyteroi". Presbyters govern through a series of representative consistories, from the local congregation to area and national organizations, commonly termed sessions, presbyteries, synods, and assemblies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Reformed Christians taught that God's word alone and no mere human opinion should be the norm for faith. "To God alone the glory" determined attitudes toward church government and worship, the design and furnishing of church buildings, and even secular authority. Reformed churches are confessional in nature, and during the 16th and early 17th centuries a number of manifestos of faith were written. While some of these confessions were theses for debate, others, such as the Zurich Consensus of 1549, sought unity between groups on controversial doctrines. This consensus, which bridged the theological gap between Zwinglian and Calvinist thought, proved important for the increasing use of the term Reformed. The very names of the Geneva, Helvetic, French, Belgic, and Scots confessions indicate the relationship of Reformed churches to the rising sense of nationhood in 16th-century Europe.</Text>

			<Text>The Methodist movement is a group of historically related denominations of Protestant Christianity which derive their inspiration from the life and teachings of John Wesley. Methodism originated as a revival within the 18th-century Church of England. The movement, however, became separate from its parent body and developed into an autonomous church. Because of vigorous missionary activity, the movement spread throughout the British Empire, the United States, and beyond, today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Methodists are convinced that building loving relationships with others through social service is a means of working towards the inclusiveness of God's love. Most Methodists teach that Christ died for all of humanity, not just for a limited group, and thus everyone is entitled to God's grace. Theologically, this view is known as Arminianism, which denies that God has pre-ordained an elect number of people to eternal bliss while others perished eternally. Methodism is characterized by its emphasis on helping the poor and the average individual, its very systematic approach to building the person and the church, and its missionary spirit. These ideals are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals, universities, and schools to follow Jesus's command to spread the Good News and serve all people.</Text>

Although Baptists do not constitute a single church or denominational structure, most adhere to a congregational form of church government. Some Baptists lay stress upon having no human founder, no human authority, and no human creed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Historians trace the earliest church labeled "Baptist" back to 1609 in Amsterdam, with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor. In accordance with his reading of the New Testament, he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults. Baptist practice spread to England, where the General Baptists considered Christ's atonement to extend to all people, while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect. In 1638, Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies. In the mid-18th century, the First Great Awakening increased Baptist growth in both New England and the South. The Second Great Awakening in the South in the early 19th century energized the Baptist movement, and the Baptist community experienced spectacular growth. Baptists became the largest Christian community in many southern states, including among the black population.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Baptist World Alliance reports more than 41 million members in more than 150,000 congregations.

			<Text>Little is known about the indigenous religion of the Indus Valley Civilization. No religious buildings or temples have been identified, and most suppositions about sacrificial fires, cult objects, and deities rest on doubtful retrospective references from Hindu practices of many centuries later. Certain recovered figures have been interpreted as representative of an earth mother goddess. There is also the possibility of a bull cult reminiscent of Mesopotamia. The early period also supports the burial of the dead as opposed to cremation. Although one must be careful not to identify Indus and later Indian religions too closely, potential clues can still be drawn through comparative analysis.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Links have been proposed between Indus iconography and Jainism. The famous Pashupati seal is also often cited as evidence of early proto-Siva worship in the Indus Valley. While most scholars no longer support this theory, archeological evidence of lingam worship has been uncovered at various Indus sites. This particular feature may have been adopted by the later Aryan peoples and incorporated into the historical Vedic religion. Another link can be seen through the god Indra. Although Indra as storm god is a functional cognate and holds a similar position of prominence as compared to other Indo-European religions, the name Indra itself is not a linguistic cognate and may be related to the Indus Valley language.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The "jar" seal in the Indus script may give another potential clue regarding Indus religion. Vedic literature mentions "sata" as a mleccha term for a kind of sacrificial container with holes. Numerous perforated jars have been found at Indus sites. The "jar-born" sage is one of the oldest Indian legends. It is possible that the later Indian Agastya figure is a direct continuation of a potential Indus priestly class.</Text>

			<Text>Little is known with certainty regarding pre-Islamic Arabian religion. It seems to have been characterized by many polytheistic beliefs; however, there is evidence in the Qur'an that some Arabs at least adopted a form of belief half-way between paganism and the strict monotheism to which Muslims were attracted. Many of the physical descriptions of the pre-Islamic gods are traced to idols, especially near the Kaaba, which is asserted to have contained up to 360. The main god in the Arabian peninsula was Hubal. The three daughters of Hubal, and chief goddesses of Meccan Arabian mythology, were Al-lat, Al-Uzza, and Manat, associated with the underworld, fertility, and time respectively. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One of the most distinctive beliefs of the nomadic Arabs was that certain of the main happenings of their lives came about through the inevitable working of Time. They cannot be said to have personified Time in any very definite sense, however, but rather to have thought of it as an impersonal force. There is no trace of their having regarded Time as a deity to be worshipped, but the concept is integral in understanding notions of predetermination and fatalism within Arabic belief structures.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One can also look to Proto-Semitic belief for clues regarding religion in pre-Islamic Arabia. Of particular importance is a trio of figures related to fertility and rainfall. Here we have a "black" thunder god, the bringer of destructive water, who kidnaps a "green" female figure, representative of the sun and life. The female figure is held captive within a wadi until the "red" hero figure, representative of the moon and positive water, rescues her. This myth might hold the basis for Semitic pilgrimage rituals, potentially epitomized by the Islamic Hajj.</Text>

			<Text>Zulu indigenous belief is primarily one of ancestor worship. The Zulu pray to the "amatongo", the venerated ancestors, and the spirits of the dead in general are understood to be responsible for the care of the living, the community's wealth and cattle, and the harmony in the kraal. The Amatongo are in charge of bringing correction and balance to the community and are as much present in the homestead as the living members of the lineage. Communion with the spirits of the ancestors is perhaps the largest part of traditional Zulu culture performed through the ritual sacrifice of cattle.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unkulunkulu, the first man who emerged from a bed of reeds, is assigned by the Zulu peoples to a period before human understanding. The knowledge of everything was brought forth by the power of the word of Unkulunkulu, known as "nommo". Yet, Unkulunkulu is not to be understood as a supreme being.  No one worships or prays to Unkulunkulu because he is so far away; a direct connection between humankind and Unkulunkulu has progressively been erased.  Unkulunkulu is as natural as rain, food, and grain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The "Lord-of-the-Sky" emerged from the reeds after Unkulunkulu, and it is from him that the Zulu get their name. However, again, the Lord-of-the-Sky cannot be regarded as the First Being, or a distant ruler who is to be revered and feared, nor is there any true relationship between the Lord-of-the-Sky and Unkulunkulu. Much less can the Lord-of-the-Sky be regarded as the native denomination of an Almighty God. Such interpretations came about only later after the introduction of Christian concepts into the Zulu mythos. Consequently, modern Zulu religious practice often focuses on the Lord-of-the-Sky as a more traditional Western God figure and prayer and sacrifice are often directed to him rather than the venerated ancestors.</Text>

			<Text>The Inuit practiced a form of shamanism based on animist principles. They believed that all things had a form of spirit, including humans, and that to some extent these spirits could be influenced by a pantheon of supernatural entities that could be appeased when one required some animal or inanimate thing to act in a certain way. The angakkuq of a community of Inuit was not the leader, but rather a sort of healer and counselor, who tended wounds and offered advice, as well as invoked the spirits to assist people in their lives. His or her role was to see, interpret, and exhort the subtle and unseen. Angakkuit were not trained; they were held to be born with the ability and recognized by the community as they approached adulthood.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Inuit religion was closely tied to a system of rituals integrated into the daily life of the people. These rituals were simple but held to be necessary. According to a customary Inuit saying, "The great peril of our existence lies in the fact that our diet consists entirely of souls." By believing that all things, including animals, have souls like those of humans, any hunt that failed to show appropriate respect and customary supplication would only give the liberated spirits cause to avenge themselves.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The harshness and unpredictability of life in the Arctic ensured that Inuit lived with concern for the uncontrollable, where a streak of bad luck could destroy an entire community. To offend a spirit was to risk its interference with an already marginal existence. The Inuit understood that they had to work in harmony with supernatural powers to provide the necessities of day-to-day life.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The nearest thing to a central deity was the Old Woman (Sedna), who lived beneath the sea. The waters, a central food source, were believed to contain great gods.</Text>

			<Text>Anito is one of a few collective names for the pre-Hispanic belief system of the Philippines. Historically, "anito" refers to ancestral spirits and can be contrasted to the term "diwatas"; nature spirits and deities. However, modern folk terminology often conflates the two terms and they are now used with a degree of interchangeability, with diwatas retaining prevalence in southern areas and anito in northern areas of the Philippines.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Anito can perhaps best be described as a form of animism; a collection of beliefs and cultural mores anchored in the idea that the world is inhabited by spirits and supernatural entities, both good and bad, and that respect be accorded to them through nature worship. Worship was often focused toward specific deities, such as Bathala, the creator god of the Tagalog, or ancestral spirits of the house or clan. Babaylan functioned as shamans and spiritual leaders as well as keeping tribal histories and guiding the traditional life of a community. Babaylan were supplemented by mananambal or albularyo, who functioned as folk healers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Anito shows strong influence of early contact with various Hindu faiths through Southeast Asia, and, in fact, the term diwatas is a linguistic cognate with the devas of Hindu religion. Today, the Philippines is mostly Catholic and only a handful of the indigenous tribes continue to practice the old traditions. However, a strong tradition of folk Christianity incorporating some indigenous beliefs survives throughout the islands.</Text>

Bahá'ís see the Báb as the forerunner of the Bahá'í Faith, as the Báb's writings introduced the concept of "He whom God shall make manifest", a Messianic figure whose coming, according to Bahá'ís, was announced in the scriptures of all of the world's great religions, and whom Bahá'u'lláh claimed to be in 1863.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Bahá'í is a monotheistic religion emphasizing the spiritual unity of all humankind. Three core principles establish a basis for Bahá'í teachings and doctrine: the unity of God, that there is only one God who is the source of all creation; the unity of religion, that all major religions have the same spiritual source and come from the same God; and the unity of humanity, that all humans have been created equal, and that diversity of race and culture are seen as worthy of appreciation and acceptance. According to the Bahá'í teachings the human purpose is to learn to know and love God through such methods as prayer, reflection, and being of service to humanity.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the Bahá'í Faith, religious history is seen to have unfolded through a series of divine messengers, each of whom established a religion that was suited to the needs of the time and the capacity of the people. These messengers have included Abrahamic figures as well as Dharmic ones; Krishna, Moses, Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad, and others. For Bahá'ís, the most recent messengers are the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh. In Bahá'í belief, each consecutive messenger prophesied of messengers to follow, and Bahá'u'lláh's life and teachings fulfilled the end-time promises of previous scriptures. Humanity is understood to be in a process of collective evolution, and the need of the present time is for the gradual establishment of peace, justice and unity on a global scale.</Text>

			<Text>The Vinca culture was a Neolithic archaeological culture in Southeastern Europe, dated between 5700-4500 BC. The culture is mainly distinguished by its settlement pattern and ritual behavior, maintaining a high degree of cultural uniformity through the long distance exchange of ritual items. Although there is evidence of potential proto-writing within Vinca culture, it is undecipherable. As such, details concerning Vinca belief must be inferred from archeological evidence; notably the abundance of ritual figurines.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Much has been written about the significance of human figurines from prehistoric sites. Most commonly interpreted as representations of a "Mother Goddess", they have always been associated with the cult of fertility and considered as of special importance for the understanding of prehistoric religion. Although the context in which the Vinca figurines have been found is not very informative, it is significant they have been found mostly with settlements, chiefly outside the house foundations and only rarely inside.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, there is little likelihood that the Vinca figurines represent a specific fertility goddess or that they were related directly to some particular anthropomorphic deity. They are rather a kind of symbol through which the primitive mentality suggests the relation between the fertility of the earth and the woman's role. Since a great number of the figurines lack specific attributes, they could easily be accommodated to the needs of the moment, perhaps for rites connected to fertility, agriculture, or various other magical procedures relating to the problems of everyday life.</Text>

			<Text>Theravada (the "Way of the Elders") is one of the two main existing branches of Buddhism. It can be understood as the more conservative tradition of Buddhism, focusing primarily on meditation and study, and is likely closer to early Buddhism than the other existing Buddhist traditions. Theravada is the dominant form of Buddhism in Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Theravada doctrine is founded on the distinction between samsara (the cycle of rebirth) and nirvana. The ultimate goal of Theravada is to escape samsara and enter nirvana. This is accomplished by achieving the Theravada ideal of the arhat; a perfected saint who attains enlightenment as a result of his own efforts. This can be achieved through meditation and insight or through the study of Buddhist canon and scripture. The role of the layman and monk are clearly differentiated by Theravadins, who do not consider it possible to attain enlightenment while one is living the life of a layman. However, laypeople actively participate in the religion by providing material support to the monks (which produces positive karma), meditating, and following the basic ethical principles of the Buddha's teachings.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Theravadins profoundly revere the historical Buddha as a perfected master but do not pay homage to the numerous buddhas and bodhisattvas that are worshiped in Mahayana.</Text>

It arose within Indian Buddhism around the beginning of the Common Era and became by the 9th century the dominant influence on the Buddhist cultures of Central and East Asia, which it remains today. Mahayana arose as a more accessible form of Buddhism in contrast to the monastic ideals upheld by Theravada.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mahayana accepts the canonical texts of the Theravada tradition (what they derisively call the Hinayana, or "Lesser Vehicle"), but also has a vast corpus of unique philosophical and devotional texts. The most distinctive teaching of Mahayana, however, is the path of the bodhisattva; individuals who postpone nirvana in order to assist and guide those beings still suffering in the cycle of rebirths. In Mahayana, love for creatures is exalted to the highest and a bodhisattva is encouraged to offer the merit he derives from good deeds for the good of others.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mahayana developed a vast pantheon of bodhisattvas, buddhas, and other powerful beings, and a complex array of devotional and meditational practices directed toward them. As Mahayana moved beyond India, it adopted many distinct local customs and, as a consequence, can vary significantly throughout Asia.</Text>

It is sometimes subsumed as a denomination of Mahayana; however, Vajrayana understands itself as a distinct path (the final "turning" of the Buddha's teachings) and one of the three routes to enlightenment along with the Hinayana and Mahayana. Vajrayana is the dominant form of Buddhism in Tibet and Mongolia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although Vajrayana may have originally emerged as a reaction to the philosophical scholasticism of Indian Buddhism, and may have been intended to return to the original teachings and practices of the Buddha, Vajrajyana rapidly developed into a complex philosophical and ritual system. As with Mahayana, Vajrayana emphasizes the role of the bodhisattva, but the tradition tends to favor fierce deities, and significantly expands the bodhisattva pantheon. An esoteric extension of Buddhist thought and practice, Vajrayana sees itself as a quicker, more effective path to enlightenment. Vajrayana ritual and devotion employs mantras (esoteric verbal formulas), mandalas (diagrams and paintings used in visualization practices), and a complex array of other rituals.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Vajrayana also places great emphasis on the role of the guru; religious teachers who have mastered the philosophical and ritual tradition. The Tibet translation of guru is "lama," and the various Tibetan schools of the Vajrayana trace long lineages of gurus who serve both as religious and political leaders.

Three primary figures constitute the supernatural world in Luba cosmology: Leza (Supreme God), Bavidye (nature spirits), and Bankambo (ancestors). Within the world of the living, the main figures are: "nsengha" (priests), "nganga" (healers), and the "mfwintshi" (witches who embody evil and the antithesis of the will of the ancestors).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Religious activates include "kulomba" (prayer), "kutoba" (praise songs), dances, ovverings, and various purification rituals. Circumcision is mandatory for men as a passage into adulthood. Besides prayer and invocations, contact with the divine is accomplished through the practice of Lubuko (diviniation) to consult the will of the ancestors. Holy places include shrines, mountains, lakes, rivers, trees, and animals (especially pythons). One of the most sacred places of the Luba empire is Lake Boya near Kabongo City.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The core of Luba religion is the notion of Bumuntu (authentic personhood) embodied in the concept of "mucima muyampe" (good heart) and Buleme (self-respect). Bumuntu stands as the goal of human existence and the essential condition for genuine governance, civil life, and religiosity. As such, religion plays a central role in defining Luba society.

Native Carthaginian religion is thus included within the broader heading of Canaanism. Central deities included: El, the most high; El's consort, Asherah; Ba'al Hadad, a storm god and the central cultic focus of later Canaanite thought; and Tanit, a lunar goddess and the patron of Carthage.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Canaanite religion is perhaps most studied today as a contrast to Biblical Judaism. Thanks to archeological finds in areas such as Ugarit, Canaanite religious texts present a contemporary to ancient Jewish religious practice. There is strong evidence through linguistic cognates and parallel mythic themes that both religions separated from the same Proto-Semitic source and perhaps even of the worship of Canaanite gods by the pre-Biblical Jewish people.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One of the most prevalent features of Canaanite religion are the limestone cippi and stelae monuments found throughout the Western Phoenician world. Today, they are often described as the Phoenician "Stone Cult". Many stelae were set up over urns containing the ashes of human sacrifices, and often would be engraved with a symbol of a deity, such as Tanit.</Text>

			<Text>The mythology, rites, and cosmology of the Sumerian people is the earliest variant of Mesopotamian polytheism, and would have a profound impact on the later religions of the area, surviving in the mythologies and rituals of the Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Hittites, as well as other groups.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The earliest historical records of Sumer do not go back much further than ca. 2900 BC, although it is generally agreed that Sumerian civilization started between ca. 4500 and 4000 BC. The earliest Sumerian literature of the 3rd millennium BC identifies four primary deities; An, Enlil, Ninhursag, and Enki. It is likely that the Sumerians originally deified cosmic and natural forces. During the middle of the third millennium BC, Sumerian deities became more anthropocentric and these nature gods were gradually transformed into city gods. During the religious high period, the sky-god An usually functioned as the head of pantheon, with the god Enlil, the lord of wind and storm, often the primary focus of cultic worship. However, the importance of individual cults varied greatly between city-states.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Until the advent of the Lugals, Sumerian city states were under a virtually-complete theocratic government controlled by independent groups of high priests. Priests were responsible for continuing the cultural and religious traditions of their city-state, and were viewed as mediators between humans and the cosmic and terrestrial forces. The priesthood resided full-time in temple complexes, and administered to matters of state including the large irrigation processes necessary for the civilization's survival.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are cultural parallels among the various Semitic religions of the ancient Near East. For example, the Sumerian creation myth and the biblical account of Noah both relate the story of a great flood poised to wipe out mankind. There are also many similarities between Sumerian and Hebrew proverbs, as well as the Judaic and Sumerian underworlds.</Text>

In the beginning he was perhaps only a local deity of the city that shared his name. From about 1800 BC onward, however, there appear to have been strong tendencies to identify him with the Sumerian Enlil. While under the Assyrian king Sargon II, there were tendencies to identify Ashur with Anshar, the father of An in the creation myth. Under Sargon's successor Sennacherib, deliberate and thorough attempts were made to transfer to Ashur the primeval achievements of Marduk, as well as the whole ritual of the New Year festival of Babylon (attempts that clearly have their background in the political struggle going on at that time between Babylonia and Assyria).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As a consequence, the image of Ashur seems to lack all real distinctiveness and contains little that is not implied in his position as the city god of a vigorous and warlike city that became the capital of an empire. The Assyrians believed that he granted rule over Assyria and supported Assyrian arms against enemies; detailed written reports from the Assyrian kings about their campaigns were even submitted to him. He appears a mere personification of the interests of Assyria as a political entity, with little character of his own.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Like many Afro-Asiatic religions, the concept of the divine-king played a key role in religious ritual. The Assyrian king, whilst not considered a god himself, was acknowledged as the chief servant of Ashur. In this manner, the king's authority was seen as absolute so long as the high priest reassured the peoples that the gods, or in the case of the henotheistic Assyrians, the God, was pleased with the current ruler.</Text>

			<Text>"It is for the god (to give) life; it is for the king to save it."[NEWLINE]- Chogha Zanbil Cylinder Seal[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Elamite pantheon is difficult to fully reconstruct with any certainty. It consisted of a number of pantheons from Elam's principal geopolitical entities, many of which functionally overlapped or waned in importance throughout Elam's history. As Susa remained in the Mesopotamian orbit for a long time, several Sumerian and Akkadian deities also enjoyed a degree of popular acceptance. Therefore, it becomes necessary to not only attempt to identify the gods by period, but also those native to Elam that originated in its hinterlands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The three principle gods appear to have been Human, his wife Pinikir (eventually conflated with the goddess Kiririsha in the south), and Insusinak. Insusinak was originally the patron god of Susa, and his rise to the role of a national god coincides with the rise in importance of Susa in the Elamite Empire. Goddesses also played a more important role in the Elamite pantheon than in surrounding states. Pinikir (Kiririsha) is often placed first in lists of divinities, and a large number of patron and local divinities were goddesses.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The essential role of the gods was to give life, to preserve it as long as possible, and finally to take it back, accompanying the dead to the other world. Nevertheless, death seems to have been the principal preoccupation of the Elamites. Most religious buildings were connected with the cult of the dead, and the principal gods were closely associated with the passage of the dead into the next world; Insusinak as the weigher of souls. The gods also served to confer and protect kingship and legitimize the rule of a new king. As the surviving Elamite sources do not include any mythological texts, they are not very informative as to the character of the gods. A few Mesopotamian texts help to fill this gap, though they often seem schematic and artificial and are, for the most part, of late date.</Text>

In common with the religions of other American theocracies, however, that of the Muisca placed special emphasis on the adoration of the sun. In Muisca cosmology, the supreme deity, Chiminigagua, was equated with light. Myth recounts how, in the beginning, darkness and silence reigned over a sterile world. Light existed only as the omniscient Chiminigagua within an impenetrable shell of clay. On the occasion of the first dawn, the god broke the shell and illuminated with beauty all that had previously been chaos. Complementing this dawn-creation myth is the legend of Bachue, fecund mother and matrilineal deity, who emerged from the waters to give birth to the people of the Muisca realm.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Muisca gods were worshiped at the streams, lakes, waterfalls, and mountains of the territory, and the holiest shrine was the Temple of the Sun. Birds were sacrificed in the temple in great numbers. In honor of the Sun, young boys known as moxas were procured from alien territories and reared in the temples as priests. Believed capable of conversing with the Sun in song, these youths were considered sacred, and their movements were circumscribed by strict taboo. Sexually innocent, they were sacrificed in early puberty.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The most notable example of Muisca religious practice to influence contemporary popular culture is perhaps the legend of El Dorado. El Dorado literally means "the gilded one" in Spanish. The Zipa used to offer gold and other treasures to the Guatavita goddess. To do so, the Zipa covered himself with gold. This tradition was well-known outside the Muisca Confederation, as far as the Caribbean Sea. Imagined as a place, El Dorado became the kingdom of this legendary golden king.</Text>

A member of the Indo-European family, it comprised a large degree of variation both geographically and chronologically, although exhibiting broad structural similarities indicating a basic religious homogeneity amongst the Celtic peoples.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Celts worshipped in constructed temples and shrines, although according to Greco-Roman accounts, they also worshipped in areas of the natural world that were held to be sacred, primarily in groves of trees. The temples were square in shape and constructed out of wood in rectangular ditched enclosures. The Celts produced votive offerings to their deities, which were buried in the earth or thrown into rivers or bogs. Additionally, there is archaeological evidence to suggest the Celts practiced human sacrifice. The Celts were animists, believing that all aspects of the natural world contained spirits, and that communication was possible with these spirits.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]According to a number of Greco-Roman writers, Gaulish and British society held a group of magico-religious specialists known as the druids in high esteem.

Vernacular Irish sources also referred to the druids, portraying them not only as priests but as sorcerers who had supernatural powers which they used for cursing and divination and who opposed the coming of Christianity.</Text>

The Serer people believe in a universal supreme deity called Roog as well as lesser ancestral and nature spirits known as "pangol".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The village shrine, or "xérém", was the nucleus of communal identity before colonization. It represents the intersection of nature, the spirit realm, and humanity, symbolically bridging the gap between human space ("dëkk") and wild nature ("àll") and bringing the spirit powers into the inhabited village. This communion is also profoundly local as pacts are between spirits and specific human communities and continue to sustain these communities. On a larger scale, a federation of villages could be called together for collective ceremonies in moments of crisis.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ceremonies that take place in the xérém deal with the divination of the rainy season, the settlement of disputes between villagers, health, and fertility. Political matters were also often discussed in the xérém. Rain making rituals were directed toward Roog, who controlled the heavens and the rain. Rituals that divined the rainy season were preceded by a ritual hunt and sacrifice in order to re-purify the earth. In the central "a cuur ale" ceremony, members of the founding lineage of the village pour libations to the pangol. After libations the "saltigi", or visionaries, make predictions concerning the coming rainy season.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The five pointed star, or "yoonir", is the Serer cosmogram, representing Roog, the four cardinal points of the universe, and the intersecting energies of the pangol, the ancestors, and nature.</Text>

			<Text>Germanic polytheism refers to the theology and religious practices of the Germanic peoples from the Iron Age until their Christianization during the Medieval period. It has been described as being a system of interlocking and closely interrelated religious worldviews and practices rather than as one indivisible religion and, as such, consisted of individual worshippers, family traditions, and regional cults within a broadly consistent framework. The best documented version is that of 10th and 11th century Norse religion. Germanic paganism was polytheistic, with similarities to other Indo-European religions. Many of the Germanic deities appeared under similar names across the Germanic peoples, most notably the god known to the Germans as Wotan and to the Norse as Odin.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Germanic tribes rarely had temples in a modern sense. The blót, the form of sacrificial worship practiced by the ancient Germanic and Scandinavian people, resembled that of the Celts and Balts. It could occur in sacred groves but could also take place at home or at a simple altar of piled stones known as a hörgr. However, there seems to have been a few important centres of worship, such as Skiringsal, Lejre, and Uppsala. Some kind of shamanistic priesthood seems to have existed, focusing especially on magical women known as völur. There also seems to have been chieftain-priests called goðar who arranged religious festivals at their own estates for their followers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There is no standard name for the collection of Germanic polytheistic beliefs. Forn Siðr is the Old Norse term for "Old Custom", used as a term for pre-Christian Germanic culture in general. It has also been taken up by Germanic Neo-Pagan groups in Scandinavia and Germany. The term Ásatrú ("Æsir faith") is the most common term employed by Norse re-constructivist groups to identify Norse Neo-Pagan movements.</Text>

			<Text>Hellenistic polytheism refers to any of the various systems of belief and practice of the people who lived under the influence of ancient Greek culture during the Hellenistic period and the Roman Empire; ca. 300 BC to AD 300. Today, Greek religion is perhaps most widely known through the Olympian gods, headed by Zeus, as well as their Roman cognates. Both have been featured prominently in Western art and proved a popular motif during the European Renaissance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As a descendant of the Proto-Indo-European religious tradition, sacrifice retained a preeminent position in Hellenistic religion institutionalized in various temple cults. Popular religion centered around paying proper respect to the gods, thus bringing "charis" (reciprocal grace). There is also ample evidence for the use of magic in this period; oracular shrines and sanctuaries were still popular as well as the use of charms and curses. Roman religion was also greatly influenced by native Etruscan belief, perhaps most notable through the concept of "numen" - a sort of guiding potential spirit. The growth of the Roman Empire also saw the rise of the deification of the Emperor and his Imperial Cult.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The waning years of the Hellenistic religions were increasingly ones of syncretism with the East. The expanded Alexandrine Empire allowed Greek thought to mix with Egyptian and Chaldean influences, giving birth to the mystic philosophies of Late Antiquity. Notably, the emanationist cosmology and the cosmic hierarchies developed by Neo-Platonism would significantly influence later Christian thought. Similarly, in Rome, Eastern mystery cults such as Mithraism would also influence both folk and official traditions, perhaps paving the way for the later adoption of Christianity.</Text>

			<Text>The extent to which one must differentiate between Minoan and early Mycenaean religion is a difficult question. There is no doubt that Minoan culture would go on to influence the Greek world, and, as such, a degree of transmission is assumed. However, Minoan religion was not transmitted through its native language, and Minoan writing continues to remain largely undeciphered.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Surviving Minoan iconography, in fact, more closely resembles the religions of the ancient Near East than those with Indo-European or Etruscan influence. This is perhaps most apparent in the importance Minoan belief assigned to the bull; an animal frequently worshiped in conjunction with the heads of the Near Eastern pantheons. Horned topped altars and bull leaping festivals formed a large part of Minoan religiosity.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, the Minoans also appear to have practiced a matriarchal religion; primarily worshipping goddess. Although there is some evidence of male gods, depictions of Minoan goddesses vastly outnumber depictions of anything that could be considered a Minoan god. Several goddesses appear to be portrayed including a primary solar goddess (possibly linked to Athena), a mother goddess, a mistress of animals, protectors of cities and household, and underworld goddesses. Votive figures were often represented alongside serpents.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Similar to Levant religion, there is also evidence that the Minoans may have practiced human sacrifice.</Text>

			<Text>In the ancient Greek religion, the twelve Olympians were the major deities of the Greek pantheon, commonly considered to be Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Aphrodite, Hephaestus, Hermes and either Hestia or Dionysus. Hades and Persephone were sometimes included as part of the twelve Olympians as well as Heracles and Asclepius. However, despite the central role the Olympians played in the Greek mythic cycle, traditional Greek religion included the worship of a multitude of gods (Olympian, terrestrial, and chthonic), as well as lesser nature spirits, and ancestor and hero cults.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Traditional Greek religion was characteristically lacking of pervasive dualism; both Olympic and chthonic deities could be portrayed as good or evil. The extent to which traditional Greek sacrifice conformed to divine hierarchies is also debatable, although there is some evidence to suggest that sacrifice was delineated according to the type of god to which it is offered; i.e., sacrifice to an ocean god was conducted at the shore.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Both Plato and Aristotle considered sacrifice to be determined by nomos (law/convention) instead of physis (nature). Sacrifice was then considered to be part of the social order, associated with paying the proper respect to the gods. Traditionally, nomoi were the products of men and thus could be changed by men. However, sacrifice also had oracular or divine sanction behind them and thus could only be changed with the approval of an oracle or divine omen. As a result, sacrifice, unlike most other human nomoi, had a validity based upon acknowledged divine instruction.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unlike the oriental mystery cults and later philosophical mysticism, traditional Greek religion viewed the soul as a reflection of the physical body; the Homeric shadow. In fact, any sort of self-deification or safeguard against old age (key components of both Orphism and Neoplatonism) would have originally been seen as blasphemous to Greek religion.</Text>

			<Text>It is difficult to reconstruct early Roman religion which consisted of a mixture of native Latin, Etruscan, and Greek belief. Much of Etruscan religion and mythology became part of classical Roman culture, including the Roman pantheon. The Senate adopted key elements of their religion, which were perpetuated by haruspices (divination specialists) and noble Roman families who claimed Etruscan descent. Greek religion also impacted the Italian peninsula relatively early, adopted into the Etruscan system around 750 BC.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Romans shared a body of myth with the other Indo-European peoples but treated it historically, reorganizing the component parts into a pseudo-historical account of Rome's origins and early days. Ritual remained a key component, evolving into elaborate religious spectacles in the late fourth and third centuries BC and helping to create the concept of Roman public space. The priesthoods of public religion were held by members of the elite classes who read the will of the gods and supervised the marking of boundaries as a reflection of universal order.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Early scholarship promoted a primitivist view, presenting early Roman religion as aniconic and centered on the concept of numen. In this regard numen was understood as similar to the Polynesian mana; an all pervasive animistic force. However, there is no evidence of the usage of numen before the 2nd century BC, and the previous application of the concept to earlier epochs is now largely considered anachronistic. Nevertheless, the term numenism is still sometimes applied as a catch-all term for early Roman religion.</Text>

			<Text>The Imperial Cult of ancient Rome identified emperors and some members of their families with the divinely sanctioned authority of the Roman State. The framework for the Imperial Cult was formulated during the early Principate of Augustus, and was rapidly established throughout the Empire and its provinces, with marked local variations in its reception and expression.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the wake of the Republic's collapse, Roman state religion had to adapt to support the new regime of the emperors. Augustus justified the novelty of one-man rule with a vast program of religious revivalism and reform. Public vows formerly made for the security of the Republic now were directed at the wellbeing of the emperor. So-called "emperor worship" expanded on a grand scale the traditional Roman veneration of the ancestral dead and of the genius; the divine tutelary of every individual.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Imperial Cult became one of the major ways in which Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity and loyalty throughout the Empire. The official offer of cultus to a living emperor acknowledged his office and rule as divinely approved and constitutional. Rejection of the state religion was therefore tantamount to treason. This was the context for Rome's conflict with early Christianity, which Romans variously regarded as a form of atheism and novel superstitio.</Text>

			<Text>The Greco-Roman mystery cults represent a unique form of religious expression in the Hellenistic world, distinct from indigenous ethnic and national religions as well as the more mystical philosophical tracts. They are primarily characterized by the secrecy associated with their initiation and religious practice. Because of this, and persecution by Christians in Late Antiquity, it is difficult to form a complete picture of the various religious schools. Regardless, many mysteries were a product of orientalism in the ancient world, incorporating religious practices from surrounding cultures such as Egypt and Babylon, as well as surviving pre-Greek and Roman cultural traditions, such as on the islands of Sardinia and Sicily. The most famous mysteries of Greco-Roman antiquity were the Eleusinian Mysteries, the Orphic Mysteries, and the Dionysian Mysteries.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Eleusinian Mysteries were initiations held every year for the cult of Demeter and Persephone based at Eleusis in ancient Greece, and it is thought that their basis was an old agrarian cult which probably goes back to the Mycenaean period (c. 1600 - 1100 BC). The mysteries represented the myth of the abduction of Persephone from her mother Demeter by the king of the underworld Hades, in a cycle with three phases with the main theme of the ascent of Persephone and the reunion with her mother. The initiated believed that they would have a reward in the afterlife.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Dionysian Mysteries began as a simple rite, but quickly evolved within Greek culture into a popular mystery religion, which absorbed a variety of similar cults in a typically Greek synthesis across its territories. It focused on the use of intoxicants, music, and other trance-inducing techniques to remove inhibitions and social constraints, liberating the individual to return to a natural state. It also provided some liberation for those marginalized by Greek society such as women, slaves, and foreigners.</Text>

			<Text>One of the later Roman mystery cults, the notability of Mithraism relies on its prominence within the empire and modern interest, which places Mithraism as a rival and contender to early Christianity. Worship of Mithras included a complex seven grade initiation system, underground temples (which survive in large numbers), and appears to have been centered in Rome. Because Mithras was viewed as a patron of loyalty to the emperor, Mithraism was also popular within the Roman military. Mithraic iconography bears similarities to other solar cults with a focus on cosmic renewal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There is some debate regarding if Mithraism, though certainly taking inspiration from orientalism and earlier mystery cults such as Orphism and Dionysism, was solely a Roman invention or if it represents an unbroken tradition of Mithra worship (the Avestan and Vedic god of the sun and contracts) imported into the Roman Empire. The Romans themselves regarded the mysteries as having a Persian origin. Dissimilarities between Persian and Roman Mithra worship, however, generally point to Mithraism being a distinct product of the Roman imperial religious world.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is difficult to trace when the cult of Mithras came to an end. Mithraism within Rome proper likely ended with the anti-pagan decrees of the Christian emperor Theodosius during the last decade of the 4th century. In areas like the Rhine frontier, purely religious considerations cannot explain the end of Mithraism and barbarian invasions may also have played a role. The deliberate concealment of Mithraic cult objects in some areas suggests that precautions were being taken against Christian attacks and the possible continued survival outside the public eye. Mithraism may have survived in certain remote cantons of the Alps and Vosges into the 5th century.</Text>

			<Text>In many ways the mystical Neoplatonism of late antiquity represents the culmination of Greco-Roman religious thought. Drawing from traditional religious practice, mystery cults, orientalism, and the philosophical tradition, Neoplatonism (especially as formulated by Iamblichus c. AD 245-325) presented a final organized revival of traditional pagan practice in the Christian empire. The ritual aspect of Neoplatonism, theurgy, even served as the backdrop for Emperor Julian's revived paganism in AD 362, briefly gaining prominence akin to a state religion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although modern culture tends to popularize Greek philosophy as the epitome of rational discourse (due to an overemphasis placed on the philosophy of Aristotle and his Peripatetic school), Greek philosophy primarily took the form of an integrated combination of knowledge and practice. For many schools, the goal of this philosophical way of life was a form of self-deification; knowledge (episteme) made one a divine man (theios aner). Neoplatonism championed the deification of the soul through the ineffable eros of and union with the One. The method to achieve this union varied. Although the earlier school of Plotinus is sometimes argued to have been purely rational, even he proposed visualization exercises structurally and functionally identical to the theurgic rituals championed by Iamblichus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Christianity ultimately reasserted itself as the dominant religion of the period, but this did little to lessen the impact of Neoplatonism on religious thought. The emanationist cosmology and divine hierarchies presented by Neoplatonism were taken up by Christian, Jewish, and Muslim theologians forming key components of later schools of mysticisms such as Kabbalah and Sufism. The rediscovery of Neoplatonic texts in the Renaissance would also inspire modern Hermetic and magic traditions.</Text>

Due to a limited historical record, not much is known about the rituals and mythology of the Iron Age Balkans; however, elements can be gleaned from surviving statuary, neighboring Greek sources, and comparative studies. The mythology of the Illyrians is particularly unascertained, only known through mention of Illyrian deities on Roman period monuments.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Thracian eschatology regarding conceptions of the soul and immortality contributed to the classical world a more total vision of humanity in contrast to the somewhat agnostic and rationalistic views of the Greeks and the excessively bureaucratic views of the Romans. It notably contained many dualistic aspects which would later resurface in many Classical religious movements. The "Immortalizing Getae" was a commonplace trope among the Greeks from the time of Herodotus. Belief in the immortality of the soul and its indestructible character was commonplace in the ancient world, making it unnecessary to single out Thracian populations in such a manner unless there existed a whole complex of religious beliefs and practices which must have been absolutely distinctive among this people or in a stratum of this people. Evidence also suggests the existence of ascetic communities among the Thracians, similar to later ascetic Gnostic movements.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One notable cult, found throughout Thrace, Moesia, Illyria, and Scythia Minor is that of the Thracian Horseman. It is attested at Odessos by the Thracian name "Heros Karabazmos" and relates to an underworld deity usually depicted on funeral statues as a horseman slaying a beast with a spear. Notably, Heros Karabazmos can be identified with Sabazios, the Thracian reflex of the Proto-Indo-European *dyeus and thus Roman Jupiter. Sabazios gained widespread importance after the Roman conquest and his symbolism was adapted into later Christian iconography.</Text>

By the 2nd century AD, however, gnostikoi had been adopted by various Christian groups, some of which used it positively as a self-designation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gnostic ideology is highly dualistic, often shunning the created material world as evil. Gnostic myth, however, is not necessarily an extreme hostility toward the creator or the material cosmos but simply an interpretation of biblical narrative that introduces inferior creators. Primarily adapting elements from Greek philosophy such as the Demiurge and intermediaries, gnosticism presents a divine hierarchy emanating from the supreme Monad. The Demiurge is a distinct creator god which emanated from the Monad and is responsible for the creation of the material world. Gnosis, or esoteric knowledge, allows the follower to ascend through the hierarchy and achieve salvation by escaping from the material world.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gnosticism is primarily defined in a Christian context. In the past, some scholars thought that gnosticism predated Christianity and included pre-Christian religious beliefs and spiritual practices; however, with the discovery of the Nag Hammadi library this view has generally fallen out of favor. To date, no pre-Christian gnostic texts have been found, and gnosticism as a unique and recognizable belief system is typically considered to be a second century (or later) development.</Text>

Some scholars have compared the level of difference between Vedism and modern Hinduism as similar to the level of difference between Temple Judaism and modern Christianity. The Vedic liturgy is conserved in the mantra portion of the four Vedas, today compiled in Sanskrit.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Vedic ritual practice was very similar to the sacrificial ideological systems of Proto-Indo-European religion. The sacrificial fire, personified through the god Agni, held a pre-eminent role as mediator between the human and divine worlds. Sacrifice was essential to both maintain and restore the natural world, or, in the case of soma rituals, to empower the gods. Indra, the thunder god, ruled the Vedic pantheon, notable as his role would be diminished in later Hinduism with the rise of the Trimurti. Other gods appear in the Vedas under different names. For example, the modern name Shiva originated as an epithet of the Rigvedic god Rudra. Modern Hinduism also includes a number of deities not mentioned in the Vedas, such as Vishnu.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The religion of the later Vedic period co-existed with local religions and was itself the product of a composite of the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian cultures and civilizations. The period after the Vedic religion, between 800 and 200 BCE, is the formative period for Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism. Fundamental concepts of Hinduism, namely karma, reincarnation, and personal enlightenment, did not exist in the Vedic religion but developed during this later period. Vedic religion was followed by the Upanishads which gradually evolved into Vedanta, which is regarded by some as the primary institution of modern Hinduism. However, aspects of the historical Vedic religion survived in corners of the Indian subcontinent such as Kerala, where the Nambudiri Brahmins continue the ancient Srauta rituals considered extinct in all other parts of India.</Text>

Shaivism includes the principle of avatar, but the concept is less developed than in Vaishnavism.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In addition to a rich and varied devotional system, Shaivite philosophical and theological systems are extremely important in the broad Hindu context. These include the Shiva Siddhanta, Shiva Advaita, and Pashupata schools, among many others. Shiva has also long been connected with rigorous asceticism, and devout Shaivas are often more attracted to asceticism than adherents of other Hindu sects.

			<Text>Shakti Hinduism, also known as Shaktism, is a term used to describe a diverse group of goddess traditions that have emerged in South Asia as the Hindu tradition has developed. It is one of the four primary Hindu denominations along with Vaishnavism, Shaivism, and Smartism. Many followers of Shaktism believe that the multiple goddesses within the Hindu pantheon are all manifestations of Shakti, the "Great Goddess". She has a variety of names and forms including: Devi, Uma, Parvati, Ambika, Kali, Durga, Shitala, Lakshmi, and many others each with multiple regional variations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Followers of Shaktism are often characterized by their attempts to attain, control, and make manifest the powers of Shakti within their own bodies. In some forms of Shakti thought and practice, it is held that Shakti dwells within the human body and must be awakened in order to attain enlightenment. In order to arouse Shakti, some followers perform complex rituals to awaken this power, likened to a coil serpent, which then moves up through the body and unites with her lover Shiva, entering the practitioner into an ecstatic-mystical trance. These forms of Shaktism are often associated with Tantric Hinduism.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Shaktism is particularly prevalent in places such as Kashmir, Bengal, and Assam. In recent decades, some of these practices, often in considerably altered forms, have also emerged in the West. Such westernized forms of Shaktism have particularly been associated with various feminist and New Age traditions.</Text>

			<Text>Smartism is the youngest of the major Hindu denominations, properly tracing itself to Adi Shankara in the 8th century AD (although the Smriti texts are much earlier, dating to between 200 BC to AD 100). Because it accepts all the major Hindu gods, Smartism is not as overtly sectarian as either Vashnavism or Saivism. However, it is still an orthodox tradition which follows very strict about rules and regulations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Smartism is based on the recognition that Brahman is the highest principle in the universe and pervades all of existence. Generally, Smartas worship Brahman in one of six forms: Ganesha, Shiva, Shakti, Vishnu, Surya, and Skanda. They follow a philosophical, meditative path emphasizing man's oneness with God through understanding. Smartism can perhaps best be explained as a form of panentheistic monotheism or panentheistic monism. The choice of the nature of God is up to the individual worshiper, as different manifestations of God are held to be equivalent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The majority of members of the Smarta community follow the Advaita Vedanta philosophy of Shankara. Smarta and Advaita have become almost synonymous, though not all Advaitins are Smartas. Traditionally, Shankara is regarded as the greatest teacher and reformer of the Smartha. Shankara established the non-dualist interpretation of the Upanishads as the touchstone of a revived Smarta tradition.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Many Hindus may not strictly identify themselves as Smartas but, by adhering to Advaita Vedanta as a foundation for non-sectarianism, are indirect followers. It is the Smarta view that dominates the view of Hinduism in the West.</Text>

Laws are derived from the text of the Quran and the hadith, in addition to using methods of juristic reasoning (like qiyas) and consensus (ijma). There are a multitude of scholarly opinions in each field; however, these can be summarized as either derived from the four major schools of thought (madh'hab) or from an expert scholar who exercises independent derivation of Islamic Law (ijtihad).

Shia is the short form of the historic phrase Shi'atu 'Ali, meaning "followers of Ali", Muhammad's son-in-law, whom the Shia believe to be Muhammad's successor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Like other branches of Islam, Shia Islam is based on the teachings of the Quran and the message of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. In contrast to other denominations, the Shia believe that only God has the right to choose a representative to safeguard Islam, the Quran, and sharia law. Thus the Shias look to Ali, whom they consider divinely appointed, as the rightful successor to Muhammad and the first imam.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although there were many Shia branches throughout history, modern Shia Islam is divided into three main branches. The largest Shia sect in the early 21st century is the Ithna Ashariyya, commonly referred to in English as the Twelvers, while smaller branches include the Ismaili and Zaidi ("Fivers"). Alevis, Alawis, and Druze are also considered sects of Shia Islam.</Text>

However, Ibadis continue to deny any but a passing relation to the Kharijites, stating that they merely developed out of the same precursor group, and whilst they may hold some beliefs in common they and the Kharijites were never one and the same.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Khariji ("those who went out") insisted that any Muslim could be a leader of the Muslim community and has the right to revolt against any ruler who deviates from their interpretation of Islam. From their essentially political position, the Kharijites developed extreme doctrines that further set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shia Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to Takfir, whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death. The Kharijites were also known historically as the Shurah, literally meaning "the buyers".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ibadi also have several doctrinal differences with Sunni Islam: Muslims will not see God on the Day of Judgment, Hell is eternal, and that the Qur'an was created by God at a certain point in time.

From this premise the school proceeded to posit that the injunctions of God are accessible to rational thought and inquiry; because knowledge is derived from reason, reason is the final arbiter in distinguishing right from wrong and what is obligatory in religion is only obligatory by virtue of reason.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The movement emerged in the Umayyad Era and reached its height during the Abassid Caliphate, but began to rapidly decline after the death of 'Abd al-Jabbar (935-1025); the most celebrated proponent of Mu'tazila. Many of the Mu'tazili doctrines and methodologies, nonetheless, survived in other Islamic schools.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The school continues to be viewed as heretical by many scholars in modern mainstream Islamic theology for its tendency to deny the Qur'an being eternal, and to allow for the possibility of free will and thus opposing the strict determinism of mainstream thought.</Text>

			<Text>Originating within Ismailism, a branch of Shia Islam, Druze beliefs incorporate elements from Abrahamic religions as well as Gnosticism, Neoplatonism, Pythagoreanism, and other philosophies, creating a distinct theology known to esoterically interpret religious scriptures and to highlight the role of the mind and truthfulness. However, despite its origins and many members of the community itself considering themselves to be, Druze is largely understood to be separate from modern Islam and is not accepted as such by the larger Islamic community.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Propagation of the religion began in Cairo in 1017 CE, led by Hamzah ibn 'Ali. It is from the name of Hamzah's subordinate, Muhammad al-Darazi, that the group derives its name. The eclectic belief system was organized into a doctrine of the soteriological divinity of al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, the sixth caliph of the Fatimid Dynasty. It is believed by the Druze that al-Hakim did not die but vanished and will one day return in triumph to inaugurate a golden age.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Druze permit no conversion, either away from or to their religion. Marriage outside the Druze faith is rare and is strongly discouraged. The survival of the religion and community across a millennium is the more remarkable in that their religious system is kept secret not only from the outside world but even from some of their own members; only an elite of initiates, known as 'uqqal ("knowers"), participate fully in their religious services and have access to the secret teachings of the hikmah, the Druze religious doctrine. In times of persecution, a Druze is allowed to deny his faith outwardly if his life is in danger.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Druze people have figured prominently at various periods in Middle Eastern history: in the Arab stand against the Crusades; in the century following the Ottoman conquest, prospering as powerful vassals; in the 19th century, dominating the Lebanese aristocracy under the ruling Shihab family; and in the 20th century in many of the vicissitudes of Arab and Lebanese development.</Text>

			<Text>Ahmadiyya is an Islamic religious movement founded in British India near the end of the 19th century. It originated with the life and teachings of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), who claimed to have fulfilled the prophecies of the world's reformer during the end times, who was to herald the eschaton as predicted in the traditions of various world religions and bring about the final triumph of Islam as per Islamic prophecy. He claimed that he was the divine reformer of the 14th Islamic century, the promised Messiah and Mahdi awaited by Muslims.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ahmadi thought emphasizes the belief that Islam is the final dispensation for humanity as revealed to Muhammad and the necessity of restoring to it its true essence and pristine form, which had been lost through the centuries. Ahmadiyya adherents believe that Ahmad appeared in the likeness of Jesus, to end religious wars, condemn bloodshed and reinstitute morality, justice, and peace. They believe that upon divine guidance he divested Islam of fanatical and innovative beliefs and practices by championing what is, in their view, Islam's true and essential teachings as practiced by Muhammad and the early Islamic community. Thus, Ahmadis view themselves as leading the revival and peaceful propagation of Islam.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The population is almost entirely contained in the single, highly organized and united movement. In this sense there is only one major branch. However, in the early history of the community, a number of Ahmadis broke away over the nature of Ahmad's prophethood and succession and formed the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement which today represents a small fraction of all Ahmadis. Some Ahmadiyya specific beliefs have been thought of as opposed to contemporary mainstream Islamic thought since the movement's birth, and some Ahmadis have subsequently faced persecution. Most orthodox Muslims have denounced Ahmadis as kafirs or heretics, and mainstream Islam generally considers them to be non-Muslims.</Text>

			<Text>The Yorùbá religion comprises the indigenous religion of the Yorùbá people, centered in Southwestern Nigeria and the adjoining parts of Benin and Togo. Yorùbá religious beliefs are part of Itan, the total complex of songs, histories, stories, and other cultural concepts which make up Yorùbá society.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Yorùbá hold that all human beings are expected to eventually become one in spirit with Olódùmarè (the divine creator and source of all energy). Daily life depends on proper alignment and knowledge of one's "ori". Ori literally means the head, but in spiritual matters it is taken to mean an inner portion of the soul that determines "àyànmô" (destiny) and success. "Ase" is the life-force that runs though all things, living and inanimate. The thoughts and actions of each person in the physical realm interact with all other living things, including the earth itself. Each person attempts to find their àyànmô in the spiritual realm. The Orishas, the divine viziers and manifestations of Olódùmarè, represent intermediary and guiding divinities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ifá represents a mystical subset of Yorùbá religious practice. It refers to a system of divination and the verses of the literary corpus known as the "Odú Ifá". Yorùbá religion identifies Orunmila as the Grand Priest which revealed divinity to the world through Ifá. This source of knowledge is believed to have a keen understanding of the human form and of medicine, praised as being even more effective than traditional remedies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Yorùbá religion is structurally similar to the neighboring belief systems of the Fon, Edo, and Igbo peoples. As such, it is probably properly classified within a larger complex of religious beliefs, including Vodun and Odinani, all of which likely developed from the same Proto Volta-Niger parent religion and then diversified according to local custom.</Text>

			<Text>Micronesian polytheism refers to the pre-Christian indigenous beliefs of the Micronesian sub-region of Oceania. Belief focused on a combination of animism and deity worship centered on a priestly class, known as itang on the island of Chuuk, whose prestige and importance in Micronesian society extended well beyond the religious sphere. Itang were responsible for the rites of war and their knowledge gave legitimacy to chiefs and provided a system of sanctions upholding the political and social order. The itang referred to themselves a mwaanesor ("effecting men"), thus defining themselves as the living counterparts of the enuusor ("effecting spirits"). However, communicating with the ancestors and spirits of the dead was not in the sphere of itang activities; instead conducted by a lower religious class of spirit mediums.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The ultimate source of itang as lore derived from Sowukachaw. He was the eldest of a set of brothers. The second was Sowufoonupi ("Lord of Pohnpei"). The third, Sowuwooniiras, is regarded as the first chief of Chuuk. The seniority implies that the itang tradition originated on the island of Pohnpei before spreading across other islands in Micronesia and ultimately derived from the sky; as personified through Sowukachaw.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One of the most organized expressions of Micronesian religion occurred at Nan Madol on the island of Pohnpei. Cultic worship centered on the thunder god Daukatau from whom the Saudeleur, the ruling dynasty, derived their legitimacy. This period also saw the introduction of foreign gods (the Saudeleur are believed to have been an invading ethnic group) and the development of cosmic intermediaries; typified as the moray eel. Other animals with ritual significance included the turtle, which represented the three major political divisions, and the dog; who guarded the city of Nan Madol as ounmatakai ("watchmen of the land").</Text>

Its philosophy and practice emphasize the necessity of self-effort to move the soul toward divine consciousness and liberation. Any soul that has conquered its own inner enemies and achieved the state of supreme being is called a "jina". The ultimate status of these perfect souls is called "siddha". Ancient texts also refer to Jainism as Shramana Dharma (self-reliant) or the "Path of the Nirganthas" (those without attachments or aversions).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Jain doctrine teaches that Jainism has always existed and will always exist, although historians date the foundation of the organized or present form of Jainism to sometime between the 9th and the 6th century BC. Jainism may have its roots in the Indus Valley Civilization, reflecting native spirituality prior to the Indo-Aryan migration into India. Other scholars suggest the Shramana traditions were separate and contemporaneous with the Indo-Aryan religious practice of the historical Vedic peoples.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Contemporary Jainism is a small but influential religious minority with as many as 6 million followers in India and growing immigrant communities in North America, Western Europe, the Far East, and Australia. Jains have significantly influenced and contributed to ethical, political, and economic spheres in India.

Although not worshipped, kachina are viewed as powerful beings which, if given veneration and respect, can use their particular power for human good. Historically, the kachina religion predates European contact; however, it remains an open question among scholars as to whether the kachina religion was an indigenous creation or an import from Mesoamerica.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Most Hopi accounts of creation center around Tawa, the sun spirit who formed the first world out of "tokpella" (endless space). Spider Woman served as a messenger for the creator and was an intercessory between the deity and the people. Hopi legend tells that the current earth is the fourth world to be inhabited by Tewa's creations. Because of degradation and perversity, Spider Woman led the most obedient people to the next higher world.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Among the ancient Pueblo peoples ceremonial practice was focused on the Chaco Road System, in particular the Great North Road. Modern Pueblo beliefs depict a North Road leading to Shipapu, mankind's place of origin, and along which the spirits of the dead travel. North America experienced significant climatic change around 1150 in the form of a 300 year drought. Evidence suggests a profound change in religion during this period. Religious structures constructed along astronomical alignments were systematically dismantled. Pueblo tradition holds that the ancestors had achieved great spiritual power and control over natural forces and used their power in ways that caused nature to change; however, these changes were never meant to occur. Possibly, the dismantling of their religious structures was an effort to symbolically undo the changes they believed they caused and to make amends with nature.</Text>

The good and benevolent black god, Ngai Narok, who shows goodness in water, rain, cattle, and children, and the angry red god, Ngai Na-nyokie, representing destructive water and sickness.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the beginning, Ngai was one with the earth and owned all the cattle that lived on it. But when the earth and sky separated, Ngai was no longer among men. The cattle, though, needed the material sustenance of the earth, so, to prevent them from dying, Ngai sent the cattle down to the Maasai and told them to look after them. Cattle retain an important role in ritual occasions, such as initiation and marriage, where their sacrifice bridges the gap between man and god. Even the grass used to feed cattle retains a semi-sacred aura and is used for blessings and as a sign of peace.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Direct prayer to Ngai is traditional in gatherings, but Ngai is perceived as terribly remote from mankind. Laiboni act as mediators between the physical and spiritual realms. Their primary role is to bridge the gap between humans and Ngai. Holding no political power, their authority is based on the efficacy of their powers, and their influence is generally limited to divining the mind or the intentions of Ngai.

The storm god Tarhunt, for example, maintained a preeminent cult and was believed to have battled the sea serpent Illuyanka.

Many ritual texts were attributed to MI-SU.GI ("Old Woman").[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Hittites referred to their empire as the "Land of a Thousand Gods", of whom a staggering number appear in inscriptions but remain nothing more than names today. This multiplicity has been ascribed to a Hittite resistance to syncretization, unusual for religions of the time. Many of these gods were the pantheon of conquered peoples, yet they retained their individual identities, even if they were identical in function, character, and name with the gods of other conquered peoples or the established Hittite pantheon. While exemplifying a great deal of religious tolerance, this approach also helped aid diplomatic efforts - foreign gods would be adopted as a sign of good faith - as well as boast of how many people the Hittite Empire had conquered.</Text>

The top deity represented the natural order; the second highest was related to the political order; and the lowest was associated with war, suggesting that war served the purpose of creating order.

Burial mounds, ossuaries and charnel houses were kept separate from the town, and ceremonial mounds were guarded and decorated with figures to appease or represent the dead buried there. The temple mounds, called mahoma in the Calusa language, measured up to thirty feet and were often topped with buildings of wood and thatch. These temples kept painted animal masks some of which were probably worn on ceremonial occasions.

			<Text>Melanesian polytheism refers to the pre-Christian indigenous beliefs of the Melanesian sub-region of Oceania. Classifying such religions is difficult due to the extreme diversity of culture and belief across the region, particularly in areas such as Papua New Guinea which represents one of the most heterogeneous nations in the world. Nevertheless, commonalities in belief do exist across the region.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One such belief is the veneration of cultural heroes. These figures should not be confused with supreme beings or gods, instead sharing more characteristics with the veneration of ancestors and the recently departed. Their setting can often vary: for hunters the forest was the place in which people lived, moved, and existed and was thus an object of awe and veneration, but coastal groups often focused on areas related to fishing. Prayers are said to the heroes in order to have a successful hunt, and, afterwards, offerings are given to them which are eventually consumed. Carvings related to these heroes are often kept in houses and ceremonies tend to be personal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In contrast to the cultural hero, more horticultural groups often focus on more concrete deities or nature sprits which have creative and transformative functions. Myth cycles involving these deities give expression to themes of death and rebirth (through such acts as human sacrifice, headhunting, and cannibalism) which integrate the human cycle into that of the vegetative world; gods, and by extension mankind, die so that plants may grow. Snakes are among the most common cultural bringers of food and agriculture.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Today, Melanesia is largely Christian. Indigenous beliefs continue to some degree among tribal groups and as folk religion. A curious footnote in the history of Melanesian religion is the continued existence of cargo cults; millenarian movements occurring in the wake of contact with the commercial networks of colonizing societies.</Text>

			<Text>Indigenous Polynesian religion represents a group of distinct but related belief systems that exists across the various ethnic groups of the Polynesian Triangle. These belief systems often share many fundamental concepts, such as "mana" and "tapu", and feature similar mythic cycles. The religion is polytheistic, believing in many deities, as well as animistic; spirits are also found in non-human beings and objects such as animals, the waves, and the sky. In Hawaii, the gods are known as "atua", and the four most prominent deities, the "ka ha", were Kane (the creator), Ku (war), Lono (agriculture), and Kanaloa (the sea). Cognates of these gods (Tane, Tu, Rongo, Tangaroa, respectively), held similar positions of prominence throughout the East Polynesian groups.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mana is a sacred impersonal force permeating  the universe. To have mana is to have influence and authority, and efficacy; the power to perform in a given situation. The word's meaning is complex because mana is a basic foundation of the Polynesian worldview. Mana is a form of a spiritual energy and also a healing power which can exist in places, objects, and persons. Certain places are believed to possess strong mana.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tapu/Kapu can be interpreted as "sacred" with the extension of "spiritual restrictions" or "implied prohibitions". In essence, it represents a code of conduct of laws and regulations universal in lifestyle, gender roles, politics, and religion. The kapu system was used in Hawaii until 1819, when King Kamehameha II, acting with his mother Keopuolani and his father's queen Ka'ahumanu, abolished it by the symbolic act of sharing a meal of forbidden foods with the women of his court. The abolishment of the kapu system can also be seen as the end of traditional religion in the Hawaiian Islands.</Text>

			<Text>Indigenous Polynesian religion represents a group of distinct but related belief systems that exists across the various ethnic groups of the Polynesian Triangle. These belief systems often share many fundamental concepts, such as mana (spiritual force) and tapu (spiritual restriction), and feature similar mythic cycles. The religions are polytheistic, believing in many deities, as well as animistic; spirits are also found in non-human beings and objects such as animals, the waves, and the sky.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Generally, Polynesian culture can be divided into two main groups: Western Polynesian, typified by Tonga and Samoa and conditioned to high populations; and Eastern Polynesian, typified by Hawai'i, Rapa Nui, and the Māori and adapted to small islands, atolls, and non-tropical environments. The Tonga and Samoa areas are largely believed to be the Polynesian urheimat; the area from which Polynesian language and culture first disseminated. As such, it is likely that Tongan religion remained largely conservative in relation to Proto-Polynesian religious practice.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As such Western Polynesian religion might be described as less complex than its Eastern brethren; however, this would be an oversimplification. Western Polynesia often elevated Tangaloa to the position of supreme creator god (as opposed to just one of the four great gods in Eastern Polynesia), and malae were simply open-air areas for public gatherings instead of ceremonial structures. Although there were spiritual healers and the chief himself would take on the role of priest and orator, a true ceremonial priestly caste did not exist in Western Polynesia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1842, when the last Tu'i Tonga chief converted to Catholicism, it brought an end to the association between the chief and Tangaloa, as related in the Tongan origin myth.</Text>

			<Text>Eastern Polynesian religious practice is a testament to the increasingly more complex chiefdoms that began to develop within the Polynesian triangle. It can be understood as subset of larger Polynesia belief; distinct but related systems that share many fundamental concepts, such as mana (spiritual force) and tapu (spiritual restriction), and feature similar mythic cycles. Polynesian religion is polytheistic, believing in many deities, as well as animistic; spirits are also found in non-human beings and objects such as animals, the waves, and the sky.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Eastern Polynesia is typified by the islands of Hawai'i and Rapa Nui, as well as the Maori peoples of New Zealand who adopted Eastern Polynesian culture to a non-tropical environment. In contrast to Western Polynesia which often only elevated Tangaloa to the role of supreme creator god, Eastern Polynesia recognized four chief gods who all took an active role in creation. In Hawai'i, these deities were collectively known as the Ka Ha, but their most common individual cognates within the Polynesia triangle were Tane (creation), Tu (war), Rongo (agriculture), and Tangaloa (sea).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A more distinct ceremonial priestly caste also developed in Eastern Polynesia, though they shared many of the same functions as the healers and Priest-Chief of the West. An important function of both of these groups was the recitation of genealogies which served to recount tradition and provide a kind of time scale which unified all myth and history, from the distant past to the present. Worship also often took placed in raised marae; constructed stone platforms reserved for ceremony and restricted by tapu.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The abolishment of the kapu (tapu) system in 1819 by King Kamehameha II is often seen as the end of traditional religion in the Hawaiian Islands.</Text>

			<Text>The Birdman Cult represents a unique evolution of Eastern Polynesian religiosity, developed on the island of Rapanui (modern Easter Island).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Orongo and Rano Raraku were the most important pan-island ritual sites on Rapanui. Orongo was associated with the founding ancestors and appears to have been initially the province of the Miru clan. By the 17th century, ideology, fragmenting sociopolitical alignments, and human and climate induced crises motivated the transfer of almost all ritual power to Orongo; with previous sites, such as the statue sanctuary of Rano Raraku largely ignored. Makemake, clan god of the Miru, traditionally superseded in importance the other clan gods of Rapanui. The sacred power of Makemake as a major creator god was believed to be incarnate in the paramount chief during like and in his skull after death. He was also closely associated with migrating seabirds.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A set of rituals growing out of the unique Rapanui geography and the ancient Polynesian concept of sacred-secular chiefly duality took place yearly, coinciding with seasonal migrations of birds and fish. Their purpose was to designate the individual in whom powers of fertility and fecundity, traditionally reserved to the paramount chief, would reside for a year. Collectively known as the birdman cult (tangata manu), the rituals included trials by ordeal originally dominated by the Miru but then increasingly open and democratic. The designated birdman was believed to be Makemake incarnate in conjoined human and bird form. His clan assumed secular powers originally reserved to the Miru.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]By the time of European contact, the power balance had shifted to warriors and secret societies. The predatory, soul-catching attributes of Makemake were emphasized and the warrior class dominated the disintegrating Rapanui political system in an atmosphere of stress created by, among other forces, probable food shortage.</Text>

			<Text>Mandaeanism is a gnostic religion with a strongly dualistic worldview particular to the Mandaean ethno-religious group. The name of the group derives from the Arabic term Manda d-Heyyi, which roughly means "Knowledge of Life." Although the exact chronological origins of this movement are not known, John the Baptist eventually came to be a key figure in the religion, as an emphasis on baptism forms a large part of core Mandaean belief. As with Manichaeism, despite certain ties with Christianity, Mandaeans do not believe in Moses, Jesus, or Mohammed. Their beliefs and practices likewise have little overlap with the religions that manifested from these religious figures.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mandaeanism is based more on a common heritage than on any one set of religious creeds and doctrines. Although its corpus is quite large, it's notably unsystematic. The most important scripture is the Genza Rabba, a collection of history, theology, and prayers. Key theological concepts portray the soul in exile in a dualistic cosmos, created by the Archetypal Man in its own image. A supreme formless Entity exists, both expressed by creation but removed from it. Savior spirits assist the soul on its journey through life to the worlds of light. Various sacraments purify the soul to aid in its spiritual rebirth. Mandaeanism also places a strong emphasis on esoteric knowledge and initiation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mandaeanism is still practiced today in small numbers; in parts of southern Iraq and the Iranian province of Khuzestan.</Text>

			<Text>Manichaeism was a major gnostic religion, originating in Sassanid era Babylonia, founded by the prophet Mani (ca. AD 216-276). It taught an elaborate cosmology describing the struggle between a good, spiritual world of light, and an evil, material world of darkness. Through an ongoing process which takes place in human history, light is gradually removed from the world of matter and returned to the world of light from which it came. Its beliefs were originally based on local Mesopotamian gnostic and religious movements.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although at times considered merely a heretical off-shoot of Christianity, Manichaeism represented an entirely independent religious heritage. However, Manichaeism was also highly syncretic and found success incorporating aspects of Christianity when spreading throughout the Aramaic-Syriac world. It also significantly incorporated aspects of Zoroastrian and Buddhist belief. Yet, Mani believed that the teachings of Buddha, Zoroaster, and Jesus were incomplete, and that his revelations were for the entire world, calling his teachings the "Religion of Light."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Manichaeism thrived between the third and seventh centuries, and at its height was one of the most widespread religions in the world. Manichaean churches and scriptures existed as far east as China and as far west as the Roman Empire (where it was briefly the main rival to Christianity in replacing classical paganism). Manichaeism survived longer in the East than in the West, where it flourished in Central Asia becoming the state religion of the Uyghur Empire in AD 762. In China, the movement was strongly opposed by Confucianism, and its followers were subject to a number of bloody repressions. Manichean traditions are reputed to have survived until the 17th century.</Text>

Historians describe Midewiwin as a flexible, tenacious tradition that provided an institutional setting for the religious beliefs of the Ojibwe people.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]According to oral history, seven great Miigis ("Iridescent Beings") appeared to the peoples in the Waabanakiing ("Land of the Dawn") to teach them Midewiwin. One of them, the Thunderbird, was too powerful and forced to return to the ocean lest he kill the people in his presence. The other six Miigis remained to teach the people and each established the various clans, symbolized by animal, fish, or bird species. Other traditions, associate the founding of Midewiwin to Nanabozho or Mateguas, trickster figures commonly associated with the rabbit.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Midewigaan is known in English as the "Grand Medicine Lodge" and is usually built in an open grove or clearing. A Midewigaan is a domed structure which, in larger communities, becomes a formal and permanent ceremonial building. The Wiikwandiwin is a traditional ceremony performed four times per year, once per season. The Wiikwandiwin is begun with a review of past events, hope for the future, prayer, and pipe smoking by the various clan heads. These ceremonies are held in mid-winter and mid-summer in order to bring together various medicines and combine their healing powers for revitalization. Each Wiikwandiwin is a celebration to show respect to Gitche Manitou ("Great Spirit"). It is customary to share the first kill of the season during the Wiikwandiwin, to show thanks to Gitche Manitou and ask for a blessing for the coming season.</Text>

			<Text>Korean shamanism encompasses a variety of indigenous religious beliefs and practices of the Korean people and the Korean sphere. In contemporary South Korea, the most used term is Muism, and a shaman is known as a 'mudang' or 'tangol'. The role of the mudang, usually a woman, is to act as intermediary between a spirit entity, spirits or gods and human beings. Mudang hold 'gut', or services, in order to gain good fortune for clients, cure illnesses by exorcising negative spirits that cling to people, or propitiate local or village gods. Such services are also held to guide the spirit of a deceased person to higher realms.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There is a rather unorganized pantheon of gods, spirits, and ghosts, ranging from the "god generals" who rule the different aspects of heaven to mountain spirits 'sansin'. This pantheon also includes gods who inhabit trees, sacred caves, and piles of stones, as well as earth spirits, the tutelary gods of households and villages, mischievous goblins, and the ghosts of deceased individuals that in many cases met violent or tragic ends. These spirits are said to have the power to influence or to change the fortunes of living men and children.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The rites themselves have gone through a number of changes through the Silla and Goryeo periods. Even during the Joseon Dynasty, which was heavily Confucian, shamanistic rites persisted. In the past such shamanic rites included agricultural rites, such as prayers for abundant harvest. With a shift away from agriculture in modern Korea this has largely been lost, and modern-day mudang are more focused on the fulfillment of the spiritual or mundane needs of urban people. Korean shamanism is distinguished by seeking to resolve human problems through a meeting of humanity and the spirits.</Text>

			<Text>The Mwari cult first established itself at Great Zimbabwe in Masvingo before its transfer to Matonjeni in the Matopo Hills. It likely originated as a rain cult to stave off drought. As drought is considered one of the greatest shangwa, or disasters / miseries, Mwari quickly rose to prominence and superseded other gods such as Midzimu and Mhondoro, who were concerned with family and territorial matters respectively. Traditions of monotheism among migrating Bantu groups, Islamic traders, and, later, Christian missionaries, would further centralize worship and elevate Mwari to the position of supreme being.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Mwari cult is also strongly associated with the origin of the Shona people at a place called Guruuswa to the north of the Zambezi river. According to Shona folklore, a voice believed to be that of Mwari summoned the elders and implored them to leave Guruuswa for another promised land; Great Zimbabwe. The voice spoke through natural phenomena, animals, trees, and grass and provided food for Shona on their journey.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In modern Shona religion, Mwari is seen as the creator and sustainer of the universe akin to God in Christianity. He is believed to be active in the everyday lives of people. In general, people communicate with Mwari through the vadzimu; esteemed ancestors. The vadzimu are believed to constitute an invisible community behind the living, always around their descendants, caring for them and participating in their joys and sorrows. Mhondoro are particularly powerful ancestral spirits, revered among the Shona because they help people interpret the wishes and desire of Mwari and also believed to ensure the well-being of large areas and numbers of people. In addition to the guarding characteristics of the vadzimu, there are also avenging or evil spirits; ngozi.</Text>

Of these, native Finnish and Estonian belief show strong influence from neighboring Indo-European (Germanic and Norse) religions, while cultures such as the Sami exhibit more indigenous elements.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In most of these religions, the world is believed to have been formed out of an egg. The firmament is held up by a great central pole or tree connected to the North Star. Several animals held sacred positions of importance such as the bear cult, understood as an embodiment of the forefathers, which was perhaps the most significant. Others includes the elk and reindeer, revered due to their importance in providing nourishment, and birds; understood to carry an individual's soul.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The shaman, known as a noaidi to the Sami, played an essential role in mediating between the living and the departed ancestors. The living and the departed were regarded as two halves of the same family. A skilled shaman could navigate the underworld to intercede on behalf of the community, or perform rituals at sacred locations found throughout the landscape.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Changes occurred in Finno-Ugric mythology as a result of contact with Baltic and Germanic tribes, as well as the transition from hunting and gathering to farming. Personifications of celestial bodies, sky, and weather deities and fertility gods gained importance in the world of the farmers. Among the Finnish people Ukko, the storm god, rose to the head of the pantheon. Another prominent Finnish deity was Jumi, although little is known about this figure.

This supreme god is a good one and its goodness is the focus of rituals and sacrifices. Yet, Khoisan religion is also highly dualistic: for every worshiper's belief in a particular high god, there is a converse evil god who is responsible for evil, war, sickness and death. For the Khoikhoi, the supreme god is called Tsui-goab and the destructive god is called Gaunab. The San combine both positive and negative aspects into one supreme god, Cagn, who takes on the role of a trickster figure. However, Cagn possesses many of the same characteristics as Tsui-goab with one notable difference being an expectation of immortality.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One key tenet of Khoisan religious beliefs is their employment of dances. Some, like trance dances directed at Cagn, trigger a supernatural and healing potency called n'um, and some are used for social bonding within the community; such as The Great Domba Dance. Although dancing under the full moon is used in many rituals of worship, particularly to Tsui-goab and Cagn, the Khoisan themselves do not specifically worship the moon.

Other categories include the "bakulu" (ancestors) and guardian spirits known as "simbi".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are two main aspects of Kongo religion that are quite distinctive. One is the practice of bringing down spirits of the dead to briefly inhabit the bodies of the faithful. The purpose of this is so that the ancestors may share their wisdom and provide spiritual assistance and advice to those here on Earth. The other feature is the "nkisi". Nkisi is the general name for a spirit, as well as any object that spirits inhabit. It is frequently applied to a variety of objects used throughout the Congo Basin in Central Africa thought to contain spiritual powers, and the creation of a nkisi as spiritual vessel holds a central place in Kongo ritual.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Kingdom of Kongo converted to Christianity relatively early, and of their own volition, with the arrival of the Portuguese. As such, a large deal of syncretization between indigenous and Catholic belief occurred in the Kongo homeland before the dispersal of the Kongo population. It is likely that the form of Catholicism practiced in the Kingdom of Kongo maintained a large amount of traditional belief.

			<Text>The traditional religion of the Igbo people, Odinani, is an ancient and complex monotheistic religion, although there are many spirits which serve as part of the overall religion. In its most basic form, the Odinani religion recognizes one God, named Chukwu (among other similar names) in the Igbo language. Like in the Abrahamic religions, Chukwu created the universe and everything in it. This Supreme Being, Ikekaike, is neither an ancestor nor a spirit, both fundamental parts of the religion. While not a physical being, they influence humanity in ways unknown.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One of the fundamental forces in Odinani is Alusi. Traditionally, every Igbo village has a shrine dedicated to their own local Alusi, which sometimes takes on the form of a human, but is more often simply a supernatural, 'being' force. Mmuo, the ancestor spirits, can take on the form of either a good or a bad spirit; distinguished men and women will be rewarded in this afterlife, while the evil will become rouge spirits. The world and the visible universe, known as Uwa, is a Mother Nature-type of being that directly impacts everyone's life - interestingly enough, the Odinani religion said that the universe was immensely bigger than the Earth, and recognised that the Earth was simply a part going around the universe rather than being the centre of it well before the Christian church did.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One of the fundamental aspects of the Odinani religion is summed up in the phrase 'Egbo bere, ugo bere' - 'Let the eagle perch, let the hawk perch'. This essentially means that everyone should be able to do what they want while not interfering with anyone else, a moral that carries on into the Igbo traditions today.</Text>

His actions are watched over and protected by the spirits of his departed ancestors, who reside in the ghost world (samandan) and who can be recalled to their shrines (their blackened stools). His course of conduct, fate, or teleological potentiality is predetermined by his immortal soul or spirit (kra) which enters his body shortly after birth and leaves before death. Birth and death do not mark the beginning and end of life for the Ashanti, but transitions between different realms of life.

The Iroquois believe in the constant superintending care of the Great Spirit, yet knowledge of him is beyond human understanding. Honochenokeh, or "Invisible Agents", are a series of intermediary lesser spirits which preside over individual objects or powers.

Festivals were led by Honundenont, or "Keepers of the Faith", and most commonly occurred during important agricultural periods. Worship and thanks were given to the Great Spirit for protection and survival. Creation myths often involve the interplay between Hawenneyu and Hanegoategeh, as well as Atahensic, the Sky Woman. Hawenneyu was said to have planted a single maize plant in the body of his mother Atahensic. This plant was a gift to mankind. In many variants of the creation myth, Atahensic was a Sky Woman who fell to earth. She died in childbirth and her body fertilized the earth so that her granddaughters could grow many things. The Iroquois axis mundi existed as a form of Great Turtle who carried the world on the back of his shell.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Characteristic of many Native American tribes in the American North East is the prevalence of medicine societies. The False Face Society is a traditional medicine society of the Iroquois similar but distinct from the Midewiwin of the Ojibwe. It is particularly known for its traditional wooden masks.

This was emphasized by a focus on a harmonious relationship between man and nature (the earth deified as Pachamama in pre-modern times), and later expressed by the concept of sumak kawsay / suma qamaña.</Text>

			<Text>The term "Suma Qamaña" is an Aymara term roughly translated as "good life". It refers to living a good (moral) life as well as invoking a sense of community and balance with Pachamama, or Mother Earth, and forms a central component of the Aymara worldview. Suma Qamaña measures success not through accumulated wealth or material progress, but by the overall health and wellbeing of the entire community. It emphasizes the importance of a harmonious relationship between nature and human beings, promoting sustainability and an understanding of an individual's place within the greater whole.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Aymara religion is primarily apotropaic magic designed to protect people, crops, and animals against the malevolence of witches and a host of evil spirits including ubiquitous place-demons. Indeed, one of the salient features of Aymara culture is the great variety of categories of magicians, omen-takers, diagnosticians, diviners, dream-interpreters, chiropractors, surgeons, herbalists, and other medicine men with various curing techniques which they may practice simultaneously with magic. The material medica of the Aymara form one of the largest yet found among an indigenous people. Their tradition concerning disease and pathology is highly developed and many Aymara groups are famous throughout South America for their folk-doctors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The ritual use of coca has developed a central role within the indigenous religions of both the Aymaras and the Quechuas. Coca is used in the ritual curing ceremonies of the yatiri (folk healers). Since the late 20th century, its ritual use has become a symbol of Aymara cultural identity.</Text>

			<Text>Throughout the Inca Empire several polytheistic religions were practiced. Most religions had common traits such as the existence of Pachamama, the earth mother, and Wiracocha; the creator. Although the Inca generally allowed and even incorporated local deities, they also controlled religion to give the empire more cohesion; conquered peoples had to incorporate the Inca deities into their local pantheons. Inca leadership encouraged the worship of Inti and imposed its sovereignty above other cults such as that of Pachamama. Although most consider Inti the sun god, he is more appropriately viewed as a cluster of solar aspects, since the Inca divided his identity according to the stages of the sun.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Worshiped as a patron deity of the Inca Empire, the Inca would set aside large quantities of natural and human resources throughout the empire for Inti. Each conquered province was supposed to dedicate a third of their lands and herds to Inti, and each major province would also have a sun temple in which male and female priests would serve. The female priests were the mamakuna, tasked with weaving special cloth and brewing chicha for festivities and sacrifices. The chief temple was the Coricancha in Cuzco. Within this temple were wall niches in which the bodies of previous emperors and rulers were exhibited along with various statues of Inti. The Inti Raymi ("Festival of the Sun") was the largest and most important of the Incan festivals, celebrating the winter solstice and honoring the emperor as god.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The worship of Inti and the rise of the Inti cult are considered to be exploitations of religion for political purposes, since the Inca king was increasingly identified with the sun god. This grew into a form of divine patronage and the convenience of these comparisons for Inca emperors proved crucial.</Text>

Although specifics differ between the various indigenous tribes, most traditions center around the use of plant extracts in order to enter trances, contact spiritual entities, or for healing purposes. The pajé, then, acts as both doctor and priest. Typically, this knowledge is passed down from generation to generation and the responsibility of the pajé as a whole falls to the tribe. Some Tupi believe that pajé have a direct link with the gods as well as the various powers and non-human beings (ancestor spirits of both humans and animals), and by extension have the power of prophecy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Tupi were divided into several tribes which were constantly engaged in war with one another. In these wars the Tupi normally tried to capture their enemies to later kill them in cannibalistic rituals. The warriors captured from other Tupi tribes were eaten in order to absorb their strength, thus, in fear of absorbing weakness, they only sacrificed warriors perceived to be strong and brave. For the Tupi warriors, even when prisoners, it was a great honor to die valiantly during battle or to display courage during the festivities leading to his sacrifice. The Tupi have also been documented eating the remains of dead relatives as a form of honoring them. However, due to the fact that our understanding of Tupi cannibalism relies solely on source accounts of primarily European writers, the very existence of cannibalism is widely disputed in academia.</Text>

			<Text>The Amarna heresy, today sometimes referred to as Atenism, covers the religious changes associated with the eighteenth dynasty Pharaoh Amenhotep IV, better known under his adopted name; Akhenaten.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the Middle Kingdom, Aten was a relatively obscure sun god. He was primarily a minor aspect of the greater god Re, depicted as the sun disk. Although solar cults had always held a preeminent place in Egyptian belief, Akhenaton raised the supremacy of Aten with the startling innovation that Aten was to be the only god. Although each line of kings prior to the reign of Akhenaten had previously adopted one deity as the royal patron and supreme state god, there had never been an attempt to exclude other deities, and the multitude of gods had been tolerated and worshipped at all times. Thus, while the early stages of Atenism appear to have functioned as a kind of henotheism familiar in Egyptian religion, the later stages suggest a form of proto-monotheism.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Pharaoh, who was both king and god, was largely controlled by the power and influence of the priests and scribes. Akhenaten's reforms cut away both the philosophical and economic bases of priestly power, abolishing the cults of all other deities, and with them the large and lucrative industry of sacrifices and tributes that the priests controlled. At the same time, this strengthened the role of the Pharaoh, redefining the relationship of god and king in a way that benefited Akhenaten. Idols were also banned to emphasize Aten's universal presence.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Atenism was Egypt's state religion for around 20 years, before subsequent rulers returned to the traditional gods and the Pharaohs associated with Atenism were erased from Egyptian records. Although modern scholars sometimes attempt to draw connections between Atenism and the emergence of Judaism, the two religions are largely considered to be unrelated.</Text>

			<Text>It is difficult to fully reconstruct the indigenous religious beliefs of the Berber people prior to the spread of Christianity and Islam into North Africa. As an Afro-Asiatic people, mythological and linguistic comparison with the Phoenician and Egyptian cultures is helpful as well as archeological evidence found throughout North Africa. However, the majority of written evidence concerning Berber religion comes from neighboring (particularly Greek and Egyptian) sources. Additionally, some ancient Berber beliefs continue to exist within modern Berber culture, albeit significantly altered.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One of the most distinguishing features of Berber religion was the importance of the cult of the dead. This appears to have been an advanced form of ancestor worship, with some ancestors even elevated to the rank of gods. After praying to the ancestors, diviners would sleep on their tombs in order to receive prophetic answers in their dreams. Characteristic of this, pyramid style tombs can be found throughout the North African landscape. Other archeological relics of Berber religion can be seen with the hand shaped altars uncovered at Garamantian sites which bear a resemblance to the Hand of Fatima and similar symbols still popular in North Africa and the Levant today.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Even in antiquity, many Berber groups had already begun to incorporate beliefs from the neighboring Punic, Egyptian, and Greco-Roman peoples. In particular, there appears to have been a close relationship between Berber and Egyptian religion. Although several gods were shared between both cultures, the god Amun is notable due to the position of importance he held in both pantheons.</Text>

			<Text>The religion of the Numic peoples of the Great Basin recognizes the central importance of power and energy; "poha". Poha, as the central vivifying energy, has a great affinity for all living things. As water is the most vitally important component of living in the Basin, poha and water ("paa") are closely linked.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Poha is not understood to be static; it is dynamic and kinetic, underlying all aspects of the universe. As singing and dancing involve rhythmical movement not unlike the poha of the universe, both play a central role in controlling the flow of power. Large formal gatherings, such as the dancing circle, serve to concentrate poha in an area. Poha is also conferred by a spirit through a recurrent dream or vision. The individual can then use the power to benefit others, becoming a shaman (pohakanten), or for personal reasons; becoming a witch (dizipoha). Power in and of itself is merely a gift to man by one of the immortals, usually the ideal of an animal species, which has existed since the Timeless Age.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Timeless Age is characterized by sameness and night. The creator, Old Ocean Woman, sprinkled some of her skin on the water and, assuming a birthing posture, stretched it out to make the land. Humans were created on an island formed by Ocean Woman as the result of the union of Coyote as father and Louse as mother. The center of the primal world was most likely originally associated with Charleston Peak just west of Las Vegas. Mountains, as a source of rivers and streams, form a web or network of power across the landscape. Likewise, the source of poha can be traced to the memory of Old Ocean Woman, for whom past, present, and future are all the same. Poha permeates the universe and tends to concentrate around the activities of life (old campsites, graves, trails) forming memory lines across the Great Basin.</Text>

			<Text>A firm belief in the existence of close ties between the living and the dead constitutes the most basic of all traditional beliefs and the foundation for Malagasy religious and social values. All the Malagasy peoples have traditionally accepted the existence of a supreme God, known commonly as Zanahary ("Creator") or Andriamanitra ("Fragrant Lord"). The dead have been conceived as playing the role of intermediary between this supreme God and humankind and are viewed as having the power to affect the fortunes of the living for good or evil.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The burial tomb, a prominent feature of Madagascar's landscape, is the primary link between the living and the dead among the Malagasy. The land upon which a family tomb is situated, tanindrazana ("land of the ancestors"), is inalienable, and social and economic practices are designed to guarantee that tomb lands are kept within the family. A number of different "souls" are recognized by the Malagasy. Among the Merina, these include the fanahy, a kind of essence which determines individual character and behavior; thus, an individual can have a good or a bad fanahy. Another is the soul of the person after death, the ambiroa, which is called to the tomb for the celebration of the famadihana, but which, over time, is believed to blend with the collective spirit of other ancestors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Malagasy mythology portrays a pygmy like people called the "vazimba" as the original inhabitants. Some Malagasy believe that these original inhabitants still live in the deepest recesses of the forest, and the practice of ancestor worship can extend back to veneration of the vazimba. Some scientists speculate that the vazimba may have been the original migrants to Madagascar from what is modern day Indonesia between the period of 350 BC-AD 500.</Text>

			<Text>What little is known of the mythology, ritual practices, and beliefs of the Scythians, an ancient Iranian people who dominated Central Asia and the Pontic-Caspian steppe in Eastern Europe throughout Classical Antiquity, is drawn from the work of the 5th century Greek historian and ethnographer Herodotus. Scythian religion is assumed to have been related to the earlier Proto-Indo-Iranian religion, and to have influenced later Slavic, Hungarian and Turkic mythologies, as well as some contemporary Eastern Iranian and Ossetian traditions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is likely that Scythian religion shared many similarities with Vedic and Zoroastrian belief. Among these are a central role attributed to fire sacrifice, the belief in a universal force (reconstructed as *rta in Proto-Indo-Iranian), gods dedicated to maintaining social order, and the use of a sacred plant (*sauma). Archeological context exists primarily from kurgans; raised earth graves. Horse and Chariot burials were particularly significant, and Herodotus describes the execution of hundred of horses at the burial of a Scythian king. The Scythians had some reverence for the stag, which is one of the most common motifs in their artwork, especially at funeral site.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tabiti was the most important god in the Scythian pantheon, although Herodotus lists a total of eight deities in an attempt to equate Scythian and Greek worship. Among these, the god Agin was attributed a unique form of worship, atypical as it was described as taking place within temples and on altars. The Scyhtian ethnic god and cultural hero was represented by Targitaos. The Enarei were a privileged caste of hereditary priests which played an important political role in Scythian society as they were believed to have received the gift of prophesy directly from the goddess Argimpasa.</Text>

			<Text>Though northern Siberia is often regarded as the locus classicus of shamanism, it would be a mistake to conflate the various shamanistic belief systems. Although sharing some key traits, a great deal of variety exists between a Yupik or Sami shaman, and few shamanistic religions reached the same level of organization as Tengriism at the height of the Mongolian Empire. However, the word shaman itself is derived from the Evenki "saman", and it is Tungusic shamanism (including the traditions of the Evenki), in particular, that formed the core example of early shamanistic studies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Traditional Tungusic religion understood a three world cosmology united by a single great river. Its pantheon included a distant creator god, ancestor worship, as well as nature spirits (of which the bear and tiger held special significance). The shaman would act as a bridge between these worlds and the spirits, able to enter into a trance and leave his body in order to walk amongst them. It is this experience that forms the core definition of shamanism, and what distinguishes the shaman from the similar indigenous medicine men found in other cultures. The Tungusic shaman himself was not understood as a healer; instead, he diagnosed the illness (understood as spirit sickness) and invited the spirits to heal the individual.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For the Evenki, when shamans invoke the spirits they imitate the steps and gestures of birds. By changing into the form of birds, they can contact individual spirits, announce their decent, or invite the spirit to possess their bodies. Once possessed, they dance according to the manner of the spirit, wielding drums and spears if possessed by a warrior, or gracefully falling if possessed by the spirit of the snow. The shaman understood animal spirits as the means to travel between the three worlds.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is likely that Tungusic shamanism was a predecessor for both Muism in Korea and Shinto in Japan, although both later religions were also influenced by Buddhist and Taoist traditions.</Text>

These religions are pantheistic and polytheistic and often include shamanic roles. Satsana Phi is still widely practiced by approximately 30% of the population of Laos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The phi are primarily tutelary gods. In daily life, most people pay respect to the phi that reside in spirit houses, who are thought to protect the vicinity from harm. Offerings of flowers, incense, and candles are given, and the spirits are consulted during times of difficulty for protection and assistance. Guardian deities of places, such as the "phi wat" of temples, are celebrated with communal gatherings and offerings of food. The phi also include nature spirits, gods of Hindu derivation, and ancestor spirits. Malevolent spirits ("phi phetu") include individuals who were bad in past lives or died of tragic deaths.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lao people also believe in thirty-two spirits known as "khwan" that protect the body. "Baci" ceremonies are undertaken during momentous occasions or times of anxiety to bind the spirits to the body, as their absence is believed to invite illness or harm. The baci rite calls all thirty-two khwan back to bestow health, prosperity, and well-being on the affected participants. Cotton strings are tied around the wrists of the participants to keep the spirits in place. The ceremony is often performed to welcome guests, before and after making long trips, and as a curing ritual or after recovery from an illness; it is also the central ritual in Lao wedding and naming ceremonies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mophi ("tellers"), are locally trained shamans, specialists in the rituals and in communication with their personal spirits and the phi in general. Using trances, sacred objects imbued with supernatural power ("saksit"), and rituals like the baci, the shaman is often consulted during times of trouble, hauntings, illness, or other misfortune that might be caused by malevolent or unhappy spirits.</Text>

			<Text>The indigenous religious belief systems of the Pacific Northwest can be called animistic, whereby the natural world is animated by nature spirits which can influence the everyday lives of humans. These supernatural entities form relationships with lineage ancestors, becoming symbolically represented in the artistic tradition as crest animals. Cosmological notions find expression in complex oral traditions and knowledge of these and the animated natural world are still a vital component of modern belief. Of particular interest is the concept of the Transformer, usually embodied by the Raven or Coyote, who is considered the active earthly agent of the Creator.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The universe can be understood as divided into three parts: the flat, circular earth in the middle; a solid realm above the earth supported by a pillar; and the seawater below the earth. Treatment of the deceased reflected status differentials. One particularly notable aspect of Pacific Northwest belief systems, especially among the Haida, is reincarnation. Sometime before death an individual might choose the parents to whom he or she was to be reborn. At death, the soul was transported by canoe to the 'Land of the Souls' to await reincarnation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Another distinctive feature of the Pacific Northwest is the totem pole. Despite popular belief, totem poles were never objects of worship. Although occasionally used to generate allusions or illustrate stories, their association with religion and 'idol worship' was an idea originating from local Christian missionaries of the nineteenth century, who considered their association with Shamanism as an occult practice. Today, many native inhabitants practice Christianity; however, this is not regarded as being antithetical to the traditional belief system.</Text>

While no native texts survive detailing the mythology of the Baltic peoples during the pagan period, knowledge of the mythology may be gained from Russian and German chronicles, as well as later folklore.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Belonging to the Indo-European family, Baltic belief is thought by scholars to have been remarkably conservative in preserving elements of the Proto-Indo-European religion. The Indo-European Divine Twins are particularly well represented as the Dievo Súneliai ("sons of god"); the children of the father god Dievas. Associated with the brothers and their father are two goddesses; the personified sun, Saule, and Saules Meita ("sun's daughter").[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, much of Baltic myth also lays buried under Christian distortion and romanticism. Among these ideas is the concept of the 'pagan pope' Kriwe at the temple of Romuva, invented as a form of counter-church to both increase the perceived threat of paganism and to shame Christians into respecting their own pope.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Baltic polytheism is closely related to the neighboring belief systems of the pre-Christian Slavic peoples, and the two can be understood to belong to a larger Balto-Slavic religious group which includes similar but distinct religious traditions that evolved amongst the separate tribes and ethnicities. This is similar to the degree of relationship between the belief systems of the continental Germanic peoples and the Scandinavian Norse peoples.</Text>

			<Text>The major focus of Mississippian religion was the interconnectivity of all life, expressed predominantly through agriculture and extensive mortuary customs. Besides the use of platform mounds, a complex and elaborate system of iconography began to be expressed in the artifacts accompanying burials. Traditionally labeled as the "Southern Death Cult", and in modern academia as the "Southern Ceremonial Complex", this iconography can be seen in shell cups, copper plates, chipped and ground objects, stone statues, pottery, and more rarely in cave art. Besides a strong religious association, the Southern Cult represents a conflation of political, social, and economic aspects of Mississippian life.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Most Southern Cult imagery focuses on cosmology and the supernatural beings who inhabit the cosmos. Iconography portrayed the cosmos in three levels. The Above World, was the home of the Thunderers, the Sun, Moon, and Stars and represented order and stability. The Middle World was the earth where humans live. The Beneath World was a cold, dark place of chaos that was home to the Great Serpent and Corn Mother. These three worlds were connected by an axis mundi, usually portrayed as a cedar tree or a striped pole. Deeply ingrained in the world view was the concept of duality and opposition. The beings of the upper and lower realms were in constant opposition to each other. Ritual and ceremony were the means by which these powerful forces could be accessed and harnessed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Great Horned Serpent is the most well-known mythological figure in the Southern Cult. Its roots go back to Hopewell times, if not earlier. It usually is described as horned and winged. Horns represented a manifestation of its power, while the wings indicated its celestial origin.</Text>

			<Text>Patagonian religion, particularly that of the Selk'nam and Haush people of Tierra del Fuego, can best be described as henotheistic. Though the Selk'nam have several classes of supernatural beings, most are understood to be mythological ancestors with only Temáukel recognized and worshiped as God. Temáukel, then, is the primordial and supreme being who has always existed and dwells in the eastern sky; Wintek.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Temáukel sent the howenh, the mythological ancestors, to earth to organize and shape the world. The howenh represent the various elements and forces of nature, but are believed to have existed as humans before becoming elements. The first and most important howenh was Kenos, who is both a creator "diety" and civilizing figure in Selk'nam mythology. Following him is Xalpen, the goddess of the underworld. The Selk'nam cosmos is ultimately divided into four sho'on or infinite skies: Wintek the eastern and most important sky, Kamuk the northern sky, Kéikruk in the south, and Kenénik in the west.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One of the most important ceremonies of the Selk'nam people is the Hain; an initiation ceremony for adolescent men entering adulthood. The ceremony featured elaborate body paintings and conical masks which have become the most endearing surviving images of Selk'nam belief. Young men would ultimately be initiated into the traditions and secrets of the Selk'nam people and train how to confront and fight malevolent spirits. </Text>

			<Text>Tjukurpa is the Pitjantjatjara word for the "Dreaming", a term within the animist creation narrative of indigenous Australians for a personal or group creation and for what may be understood as the "timeless time" of formative creation and perpetual creating. It is known in Yankunytjatjara as Wapar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Dreaming can be seen as an embodiment of creation, which gives meaning to everything. It establishes the rules governing relationships between the people, the land and all things for Aboriginal people. "Dreaming" is also often used to refer to an individual or group's set of beliefs or spirituality. For instance, an indigenous Australian might say that he or she has Kangaroo Dreaming, or Shark Dreaming, or Honey Ant Dreaming, or any combination of Dreamings pertinent to their "country".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the Aboriginal world view, every event leaves a record in the land. Everything in the natural world is a result of the past, present and future actions of the archetypal beings, whose actions are continuously creating the world. Whilst Europeans consider these cultural ancestors to be mythical, many Aboriginal people believe in their present and future literal existence. The meaning and significance of particular places and creatures is wedded to their origin in the Dreaming, and certain places have a particular potency, which the Aborigines call its dreaming. In this dreaming resides the sacredness of the earth.</Text>

			<Text>The Mesoamerican religions of Central America represent a closely related but distinct group of faiths, many of which had elements of human sacrifice in connection with a large number of religious festivals which were held according to astrological calendars.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Aztec world consisted of three main parts: the earth world on which humans lived, an underworld which belonged to the dead, and the upper plane in the sky. The earth and the underworld were both open for humans to enter, whereas the upper plane in the sky was impenetrable to humans. Existence was envisioned as straddling the two worlds in a cycle of birth, life, death, and rebirth. Thus as the sun was believed to dwell in the underworld at night in order to be reborn in the morning and maize kernels were interred to later sprout anew, so the human and divine existence was also envisioned as being cyclical.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sacrificial rituals among the Aztecs and in Mesoamerica in general must be seen in the context of religious cosmology; sacrifice and death was necessary for the continued existence of the world. Likewise each part of life had one or more deities associated with it and these had to be paid their dues in order to achieve success. Gods were paid with sacrificial offerings of food, flowers, effigies, and quail. But the larger the effort required of the god, the greater the sacrifice. Blood fed the gods and kept the sun from falling. For some of the most important rites, a priest would offer his own blood, by cutting his ears, arms, tongue, thighs, chest, genitals, or offer a human life, or even a god's life.

			<Text>Traditional Mayan religion was based on a pantheon of nature gods, including those of the sun, moon, rain, and corn. A priestly class was responsible for an elaborate cycle of rituals and ceremonies which paid close attention to astrological cycles and the projection of calendrical models onto the landscape. Mayan mythological narrative was concerned with the origin of natural and cultural phenomena, often with the moral aim of defining the ritual relationship between mankind and its environment.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is uncertain if the organization of a pantheon originated during the Classic Period or if, instead, was introduced during the Postclassic Period by Toltec or Itzá invaders. Several gods who played significant roles in the Postclassic codices, however, can be identified on earlier Maya monuments. The most important of these was Itzamná, a creator deity thought to reside in the sky. The cult of Kukulkan (Quetzalcoatl), although originally centred at the ancient city of Chichén Itzá, was the first Mesoamerican religion to transcend the old Classic Period linguistic and ethnic divisions. This cult facilitated communication and peaceful trade among peoples of many different social and ethnic backgrounds.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Indigenous Mayan religion still continues to be practiced by rural communities of the Yucatan today, although highly syncretized with Christianity. Known as costumbre ("custom"), it portrays Mayan identity as based on one's relation with the universe, mother nature, the earth as source of life, maize as a marker of one's culture that has been transmitted through its material production, and places a strong emphasis on oral tradition. Notably, costumbre places much less emphasis on personal salvation, instead focusing on the health of the community.</Text>

The name "Santería" derives from the correspondences made by some devotees between the Yoruba deities called orishas and the saints of Roman Catholic piety. As Santería developed from Yoruba theology, it is distinct from Voodoo and Palo, which developed from Fon and Bakongo theology respectively.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Santería is based upon the development of personal relationships through divination, sacrifice, initiation, and mediumship between practitioners of the religion and the orisha deities, who provide their devotees with protection, wisdom, and success and who guide devotees in times of crisis.

			<Text>In Sioux tradition, Wakan Tanka can be translated as the "Great Spirit", or, perhaps more accurately, as the "Great Mystery". The Sioux regard the universe as ultimately incomprehensible; life, growth, and death are mysterious and suggestive of powers difficult to understand. Since time itself does not embody notions of change and progress, nothing in the universe can be considered to be inevitable. This incomprehensibility and unpredictability of the universe, anything difficult to understand, is called "wakan", which also connotes the animating force of the universe, the totality of which is "Wakan Tanka". Wakan Tanka, then, can be understood as the sum total of the personified powers that brought all things into being; sometimes embodied as the Six Grandfathers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ritual seeks to placate the wakan beings or powers (which may be predisposed to good or evil) but also involves a process of continuing revelation. As visions are seen as a means through which the supernatural world may contact and advise the natural world, the interpretation of dreams and visions remains an important part of Lakota society. Called "hanblecheyapi", the vision quest stands out as one of the primary rites of passage among the members of the Lakota community. The purpose of a vision quest is for the participant to receive guidance from the spirit world and then integrate his vision into the life of the community by performing it ritually in public. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The white buffalo fulfills the role of a "civilizing spirit". According to legend, people lost the ability to talk and communicate with the Creator. The White Buffalo Calf Woman was sent by the Creator to teach the people how to pray with the sacred pipe. She also taught them the seven sacred ceremonies to ensure a future with harmony, peace, and balance.</Text>

The Mapuche people are guided by the machi, spiritual leaders (mainly women) who are the mediums of communication with the celestial family in order to maintain harmony and combat the malicious power of wekufe ("evil"). The Machi's supernatural power is complemented by the sacred kultrun drum they possess and play during their prayers and religious activities. The kultrun often depicts Mapuche cosmology; the earth divided by the four cardinal points.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Nguillatún, a religious festival, most fully expresses the heart of Mapuche religion. It is celebrated at different times of the year to re-establish the balance in the lives of the Mapuche. This can be in response to natural disasters or social disorder. However, it can also be a ritual to give thanks for a harvest or other good things. The Nguillatún ritual brings the entire Mapuche community together, the living as well as the dead, and is directed principally to Nguenechen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Modern Mapuche belief is highly syncretic incorporating elements from both Catholicism and Protestant movements. An equally important aspect of Mapuche belief and society is the remembered history of independence and resistance from 1540 (Spanish and then Chileans) and of the treaty with the Chilean government in the 1870s. Memories, stories, and beliefs, often very local and particularized, are a significant part of the Mapuche traditional culture.</Text>

			<Text>Yazdânism is a neologism to denote a group of interrelated native Kurdish monotheistic religions: Yazidi, Yâresân, and Ishikism. The Yazdâni faiths were the primary religion of the inhabitants of the Zagros Mountains, including Kurds, until their progressive Islamization in the 10th century. These religions are highly syncretic, representing a combination of Zoroastrian, Manichaean, Jewish, Nestorian Christian, and Islamic elements.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Yârsânî  believe that the universe is composed of two distinct yet interrelated worlds: the internal ("batini") and the external ("zahiri"), each having its own order and rules. Although humans are only aware of the outer world, their lives are governed according to the rules of the inner world. Other important elements of their belief system include the idea that the Divine Essence has successive manifestations in human form ("mazhariyyat ") and the belief in transmigration of the soul.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The chief divine figure of the Yazidi is Melek Taus, who is worshipped in the form of a peacock. He rules the universe with six other angels, but all seven are subordinate to the supreme God, who has had no direct interest in the universe since he created it. Yazidi are antidualists; they deny the existence of evil and therefore also reject sin, the Devil, and hell. The breaking of divine laws is expiated by way of metempsychosis, or transmigration of souls, which allows for the progressive purification of the spirit. The Yazidi relate that, when the Devil repented of his sin of pride before God, he was pardoned and replaced in his previous position as chief of the angels; this myth has earned the Yazidi an undeserved reputation as Devil worshippers.</Text>

Ancestral spirits were also highly honored, particularly those of chiefs. Bones or skulls might be incorporated into sculptural zemis.

The father put the son's bones into a gourd. When the bones turned into fish, the gourd broke, and all the water of the world came pouring out.
